Comparisons between estimates of average protein translation rate φ̂ SelAC obtained from SelAC+Γ and direct measurements of expression for individual yeast taxa across the 100 selected genes from Salichos and Rokas (2013) measured during log-growth phase. Estimates of φ̂ SelAC were generated by dividing the composite term ψ' by B(a<sub>i</sub> |a<sub>∗</sub> ). Gene expression was measured using either RNA-Seq (a)-(c) or microarray (d)-(e). The equations in the upper left hand corner of each panel represent the regression fit and the Pearson correlation coefficient r.
