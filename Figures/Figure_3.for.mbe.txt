Comparisons between ω FMutSel , which is the nonsynonymous/synonymous mutation ratio in FMutSel, SelAC+Γ estimates of protein functionality production rates ψ̂ SelAC (a), RNA-Seq based measurements of mRNA abundance φ RNA-seq (b), and ROC-SEMPPER’s estimates of protein translation rates φ ROC , which are based solely on S. cerevisiae’s patterns of codon usage bias (c), for S. cerevisiae across the 100 selected genes from Salichos and Rokas (2013). As in Figure 2, the equations in the upper right hand corner of each panel provide the regression fit and correlation coefficient.
