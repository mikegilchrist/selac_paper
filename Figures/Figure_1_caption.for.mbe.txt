Summary of a 5-gene simulation for a SelAC model where we assume α <sub>G</sub> = ∞, and thus, no site-specific sensitivity in the generating model. The ‘known’ parameters were based on fitting the SelAC model to the 106 gene data set andphylogeny of Rokas et al. (2003), with gene choice being based on five evenly spaced points along the rank order of thegene specific composite parameter ψ'<sub>g</sub> . The points and associated uncertainty in the estimates of the gene-specific averageprotein synthesis rate, or ψ (calculated from ψ') (a), nucleotide mutation rates under the UNREST model (b), proportion ofcorrect optimal amino acids for a given gene (c), and estimates of the individual edge lengths are based the mean and 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles across all 50 simulated datasets (d). Gene index on the x-axis refers to the arbitrary number assigned to the simulated gene.
