(a) Maximum likelihood estimates of branch lengths under SelAC+Γ for 100 selected genes from Salichos and Rokas (2013). Tests of model adequacy for S. cerevisiae (b) and S. castellii (c) indicated that, when these taxa are removed from the tree, and their sequences are simulated, the parameters of SelAC+Γ exhibit functionality B(a<sub>i</sub> |a<sub>∗</sub> ) that is far closer to the observed (dashed black line) than data sets produced from parameters of either FMutSel or GTR + Γ.
