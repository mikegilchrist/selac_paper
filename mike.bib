abstract ={An evolutionary model that combines protein secondary structure and amino acid replacement is introduced. It allows likelihood analysis of aligned protein sequences and does not require the underlying secondary (or tertiary) structures of these sequences to be known. One component of the model describes the organization of secondary structure along a protein sequence and another specifies the evolutionary process for each category of secondary structure. A database of proteins with known secondary structures is used to estimate model parameters representing these two components. Phylogeny, the third component of the model, can be estimated from the data set of interest. As an example, we employ our model to analyze a set of sucrose synthase sequences. For the evolution of sucrose synthase, a parametric bootstrap approach indicates that our model is statistically preferable to one that ignores secondary structure.},

The strengths of these associations are statistically evaluated by applying the models of protein evolution to 11 diverse sets of protein sequences. Parametric bootstrap tests indicate that the solvent accessibility status of a site has a particularly strong association with the process of amino acid replacement that it experiences. Significant association between secondary structure environment and the amino acid replacement process is also observed. Careful description of the length distribution of secondary structure elements and of the organization of secondary structure and solvent accessibility along a protein did not always significantly improve the fit of the evolutionary models to the data sets that were analyzed. As indicated by the strength of the association of both solvent accessibility and secondary structure with amino acid replacement, the process of protein evolution{\textemdash}both above and below the species level{\textemdash}will not be well understood until the physical constraints that affect protein evolution are identified and characterized.},

abstract = "Previously proposed methods for protein secondary structure prediction from multiple sequence alignments do not efficiently extract the evolutionary information that these alignments contain. The predictions of these methods are less accurate than they could be, because of their failure to consider explicitly the phylogenetic tree that relates aligned protein sequences. As an alternative, we present a hidden Markov model approach to secondary structure prediction that more fully uses the evolu
tionary information contained in protein sequence alignments. A representative example is presented, and three experiments are performed that illustrate how the appropriate representation of evolutionary relatedness can improve inferences. We explain why similar improvement can be expected in other secondary structure prediction methods and indeed any comparative sequence analysis method."

Here we investigate the population-genetic variation and population structure of S. cerevisiae by sequencing the four loci CDC19, PHD1, FZF1 and SSU1 in 27 strains. Sequence analysis demonstrates a distinct population structure in S. cerevisiae, distinguishing strains collected from a Pennsylvanian oak forest and strains collected from vineyards, perhaps due to ecological rather than geographic factors. The low level of conflict observed between the gene trees estimated for each locus implies moderate recombination in nature. High polymorphism in the gene SSU1 provides evidence of diversifying selection on its protein product, a sulfite exporter, perhaps associated with the use of sulfur-based fungicides in vineyards. FZF1, encoding a transcription factor regulating the expression level of SSU1, displays even greater polymorphism. This, the first multilocus sequence study of population structure in natural isolates of S. cerevisiae, is the first study to demonstrate population structure within S. cerevisiae, and the first study to detect historical selection on a locus important to the natural history of wine yeast.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Comparative genomics is the analysis and comparison of genomes from different species. This area of research is driven by the large number of sequenced genomes and heavily relies on efficient algorithms and software to perform pairwise and multiple genome comparisons. Results: Most of the software tools available are tailored for one specific task. In contrast, we have developed a novel system CoCoNUT (Computational Comparative geNomics Utility Toolkit) that allows solving several different tasks in a unified framework: (1) finding regions of high similarity among multiple genomic sequences and aligning them, (2) comparing two draft or multichromosomal genomes, (3) locating large segmental duplications in large genomic sequences, and (4) mapping cDNA/EST to genomic sequences. Conclusion: CoCoNUT is competitive with other software tools w.r.t. the quality of the results. The use of state of the art algorithms and data structures allows CoCoNUT to solve comparative genomics tasks more efficiently than previous tools. With the improved user interface (including an interactive visualization component), CoCoNUT provides a unified, versatile, and easy-to-use software tool for large scale studies in comparative genomics.},

Are proteins encoded by stable or unstable nucleotide sequences? If selection for variability is prevalent, one could expect an excess of unstable sequences. Alternatively, if selection against targets for errors were substantial, an excess of stable sequences would be expected. We screened the genome sequences of different organisms for an important determinant of stability, the presence of mononucleotide repeats. We find that codons are used to encode proteins in a way that avoids the emergence of mononucleotide repeats, and we can attribute this bias to selection rather than a neutral process. This indicates that selection for stability, rather than for the generation of variation, substantially influences how information is encoded in the genome.},

  Abstract                 = {It is generally believed that the first organisms did not age, and that aging thus evolved at some point in the history of life. When and why this transition occurred is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Recent reports of aging in bacteria suggest that aging predates the emergence of eukaryotes and originated in simple unicellular organisms. Here we use simple models to study why such organisms would evolve aging. These models show that the differentiation between an aging parent and a rejuvenated offspring readily evolves as a strategy to cope with damage that accumulates due to vital activities. We use measurements of the age-specific performance of individual bacteria to test the assumptions of the model, and find evidence that they are fulfilled. The mechanism that leads to aging is expected to operate in a wide range of organisms, suggesting that aging evolved early and repeatedly in the history of life. Aging might thus be a more fundamental aspect of cellular organisms than assumed so far. },

Analysis of clones isolated from these populations showed that a number (17) of large-scale chromosomal-length variants and rearrangements were present in the populations at their termination. Nine of the 16 yeast chromosomes were involved in such changes. Few of the changes could be explained by copy-number increases in the structural loci for acid phosphatase. Several considerations concerning the nature and frequency of the chromosome-length variants observed lead us to conclude that they are selectively advantageous. },

  Abstract                 = {Mitochondrial gene content is highly variable across extant eukaryotes. The number of mitochondrial protein genes varies from 3 to 67, while tRNA gene content varies from 0 to 27. Moreover, these numbers exclude the many diverse lineages of non-respiring eukaryotes that lack a mitochondrial genome yet still contain a mitochondrion, albeit one often highly derived in ultrastructure and metabolic function, such as the hydrogenosome. Diversity in tRNA gene content primarily reflects differential usage of imported tRNAs of nuclear origin. In the case of protein genes, most of this diversity reflects differential degrees of functional gene transfer to the nucleus, with more minor contributions resulting from gene loss from the cell as a consequence of either substitution via a functional nuclear homolog or the cell's dispensation of the function of the gene product. The tempo and pattern of mitochondrial gene loss is highly episodic, both across the broad sweep of eukaryotes and within such well-studied groups as angiosperms. All animals, some plants, and certain other groups of eukaryotes are mired in profound stases in mitochondrial gene content, whereas other lineages have experienced relatively frequent gene loss. Loss and transfer to the nucleus of ribosomal protein and succinate dehydrogenase genes has been especially frequent, sporadic, and episodic during angiosperm evolution. Potential mechanisms for activation of transferred genes have been inferred, and intermediate stages in the process have been identified by comparative studies. Several hypotheses have been proposed for why mitochondrial genes are transferred to the nucleus, why mitochondria retain genomes, and why functional gene transfer is almost exclusively unidirectional.

The genome comprises eight chromosomes among which achromosomal arm of 1Mb has a G + C-content much higher than the rest of the genome. We identified 252 active replication origins in L. kluyveri and found considerable divergence in origin location with S. cerevisiae and with Lachancea waltii. Although some global features of S. cerevisiae replication are conserved: Centromeres replicate early, whereas telomeres replicate late, we found that replication origins both in L. kluyveri and L. waltii do not behave as evolutionary fragile sites. In L. kluyveri, replication timing along chromosomes alternates between regions of early and late activating origins, except for the 1Mb GC-rich chromosomal arm. This chromosomal arm contains an origin consensus motif different from other chromosomes and is replicated early during S-phase. We showed that precocious replication results from the specific absence of late firing origins in this chromosomal arm. In addition, we found a correlation between GC-content and distance from replication origins as well as a lack of replication-associated compositional skew between leading and lagging strands specifically in this GC-rich chromosomal arm. These findings suggest that the unusual base composition in the genome of L. kluyveri could be linked to replication.},

  Abstract                 = {After the termination step of protein synthesis, a deacylated {tRNA} and {mRNA} remain associated with the ribosome. The ribosome-recycling factor (RRF), together with elongation factor G (EF-G), disassembles this posttermination complex into {mRNA}, {tRNA}, and the ribosome. We have obtained a three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopic map of a complex of the \emph{Escherichia coli} 70S ribosome and RRF. We find that RRF interacts mainly with the segments of the large ribosomal subunit's (50S) rRNA helices that are involved in the formation of two central intersubunit bridges, B2a and B3. The binding of RRF induces considerable conformational changes in some of the functional domains of the ribosome. As compared to its binding position derived previously by hydroxyl radical probing study, we find that RRF binds further inside the intersubunit space of the ribosome such that the tip of its domain I is shifted (by approximate to 13 Angstrom) toward protein L5 within the central protuberance of the 50S subunit, and domain II is oriented more toward the small ribosomal subunit (30S). Overlapping binding sites of RRF, EF-G, and the P-site {tRNA} suggest that the binding of EF-G would trigger the removal of deacylated {tRNA} from the P site by moving RRF toward the ribosomal E site, and subsequent removal of {mRNA} may be induced by a shift in the position of 16S rRNA helix 44, which harbors part of the {mRNA}. },

  Abstract                 = {Most models of genome size evolution emphasize changes in relative rates of and/or the efficacy of selection on insertions and deletions. However, transposable elements (TEs) are a major contributor to genome size evolution, and since they experience their own selective pressures for expansion, genome size changes may in part be driven by the dynamics of co-evolution between TEs and their hosts. Under this perspective, predictions about the conditions that allow for genome expansion may be altered. In this review, we outline the evidence for TE-host co-evolution, discuss the conditions under which these dynamics can change, and explore the possible contribution to the evolution of genome size. Aided partly by advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of TE silencing via small RNAs, there is growing evidence that the evolution of transposition rates can be important in driving genome expansion and contraction. Shifts in genome size and transposon abundance associated with interspecific hybridization and changes in mating system are consistent with an important role for transposition rate evolution, although other possible explanations persist. More understanding of the potential for the breakdown of host silencing mechanisms and/or the potential for TEs to evade host immune responses will improve our understanding of the importance of changes in TE activity in driving genome size evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Transfer RNA's role in decoding the genome is critical to the accuracy and efficiency of protein synthesis. Though modified nucleosides were identified in RNA 50 years ago, only recently has their importance to {tRNA}'s ability to decode cognate and wobble codons become apparent. RNA modifications are ubiquitous. To date, some 100 different posttranslational modifications have been identified. Modifications of {tRNA} are the most extensively investigated; however, many other RNAs have modified nucleosides. The modifications that occur at the first, or wobble position, of {tRNA}'s anticodon and those 3'-adjacent to the anticodon are of particular interest. The {tRNA}s most affected by individual and combinations of modifications respond to codons in mixed codon boxes where distinction of the third codon base is important for discriminating between the correct cognate or wobble codons and the incorrect near-cognate codons (e.g. AAA/G for lysine versus AAU/C asparagine). In contrast, other modifications expand wobble codon recognition, such as U.U base pairing, for {tRNA}s that respond to multiple codons of a 4-fold degenerate codon box (e.g. GUU/A/C/G for valine). Whether restricting codon recognition, expanding wobble, enabling translocation, or maintaining the messenger RNA, reading frame modifications appear to reduce anticodon loop dynamics to that accepted by the ribosome. Therefore, we suggest that anticodon stem and loop domain nucleoside modifications allow a limited number of {tRNA}s to accurately and efficiently decode the 61 amino acid codons by selectively restricting some anticodon-codon interactions and expanding others. },

  Abstract                 = {The biosynthesis of RNA includes its post-transcriptional modifications, and the crucial functions of these modifications have supported their conservation within all three kingdoms. For example, the modifications located within or adjacent to the anticodon of the transfer RNA ({tRNA}) enhance the accuracy of codon binding, maintain the translational reading frame and enable translocation of the {tRNA} from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome. Although composed of different chemistries, the more than 70 known modifications of {tRNA} have in common their ability to reduce conformational dynamics, and to bring order to the internal loops and hairpin structures of RNA. The modified nucleosides of the anticodon domain of {tRNA} restrict its dynamics and shape its architecture; therefore, the need of the ribosome to constrain or remodel each {tRNA} to fit the decoding site is diminished. This concept reduces an entropic penalty for translation and provides a physicochemical basis for the conservation of RNA modifications in general. },

  Abstract                 = {The genetic code is degenerate, in that 20 amino acids are encoded by 61 triplet codes. In 1966, Francis Crick hypothesized that the cell's limited number of tRNAs decoded the genome by recognizing more than one codon. The ambiguity of that recognition resided in the third base-pair, giving rise to the Wobble Hypothesis. Post-transcriptional modifications at tRNA's wobble position 34, especially modifications of uridine 34, enable wobble to occur. The Modified Wobble Hypothesis proposed in 1991 that specific modifications of a tRNA wobble nucleoside shape the anticodon architecture in such a manner that interactions were restricted to the complementary base plus a single wobble pairing for amino acids with twofold degenerate codons. However, chemically different modifications at position 34 would expand the ability of a tRNA to read three or even four of the fourfold degenerate codons. One foundation of Crick's Wobble Hypothesis was that a near-constant geometry of canonical base-pairing be maintained in forming all three base-pairs between the tRNA anticodon and mRNA codon on the ribosome. In accepting an aminoacyl-tRNA, the ribosome requires maintenance of a specific geometry for the anticodon-codon base-pairing. However, it is the post-transcriptional modifications at tRNA wobble position 34 and purine 37, 3'-adjacent to the anticodon, that pre-structure the anticodon domain to ensure the correct codon binding. The modifications create both the architecture and the stability needed for decoding through restraints on anticodon stereochemistry and conformational space, and through selective hydrogen bonding. A physicochemical understanding of modified nucleoside contributions to the tRNA anticodon domain architecture and its decoding of the genome has advanced RNA world evolutionary theory, the principles of RNA chemistry, and the application of this knowledge to the introduction of new amino acids to proteins.

  Abstract                 = {The fixation of mutant alleles has been studied with models assuming various spatial population structures. In these models, the structure of the metapopulation that we call the "landscape" (number, size and connectivity of subpopulations) is often static. However, natural Populations are subject to repetitive Population size variations, fragmentation and secondary contacts at different spatiotemporal scales due to geological, climatic and ecological processes. In this paper, we examine how such dynamic landscapes can alter mutant fixation probability and time to fixation. We consider three stochastic landscape dynamics: (i) the population is subject to repetitive bottlenecks, (ii) to the repeated alternation of fragmentation and fusion of denies with a constant population carrying capacity, (iii) idem with a variable carrying capacity. We show by deriving a variance, a coalescent and a harmonic mean population effective size, and with simulations that these landscape dynamics generate repetitive founder effects which counteract selection, thereby decreasing the fixation probability of an advantageous mutant but accelerate fixation when it occurs. For models (ii) and (iii), we also highlight an antagonistic "refuge effect" which can strongly delay mutant fixation. The predominance of either founder effects or refuge effects determines the time to fixation and mainly depends on the characteristic time scales of the landscape dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogen and its transmission and epidemiology have been extensively studied; it has been found that H. pylori's prevalence and infection outcome is characterized by marked differences between the developing and the developed worlds. Recent data on genomic analyses and comparative core genome haplotyping have revealed that H. pylori has coevolved with its human host. While several studies advocate the protective effects of H. pylori colonization, it is prudent to systematically unleash the role of the strong virulence apparatus present within most H. pylori strains and to determine how to disarm them (or protect the host from the effects) if the intent is to allow it to remain a friendly organism or to use it as a vaccine delivery tool. While genotyping and phenotyping based on a few genetic markers have not provided much insight into such issues, use of replicate/chronological genomics (of virulent versus innocuous strains) coupled with functional screens in animal models is expected to be able to explain the acquisition and evolution of virulence factors of H. pylori and their discreet associations with serious clinical outcomes such as gastric cancer.

Since the fitness cost of a translational misincorporation will depend on how the amino acid substitution affects protein function, selection for translational accuracy predicts an association between codon usage in DNA and functional constraint at the protein level. The frequency of preferred codons is significantly higher at codons conserved for amino acids than at nonconserved codons in 38 genes compared between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis or Drosophila pseudoobscura (Z = 5.93, P < 10(-6)). Preferred codon usage is also significantly higher in putative zinc-finger and homeodomain regions than in the rest of 28 D. melanogaster transcription factor encoding genes (Z = 8.38, P < 10(-6)). Mutational alternatives (within-gene differences in mutation rates, amino acid changes altering codon preference states, and doublet mutations at adjacent bases) do not appear to explain this association between synonymous codon usage and amino acid constraint. },

  Abstract                 = {Patterns of codon usage and ''silent'' DNA divergence suggest that natural selection discriminates among synonymous codons in Drosophila. ''Preferred'' codons are consistently found in higher frequencies within their synonymous families in Drosophila melanogaster genes. This suggests a simple model of silent DNA evolution where natural selection favors mutations from unpreferred to preferred codons (preferred changes). Changes in the opposite direction, from preferred to unpreferred synonymous codons (unpreferred changes), are selected against. Here, selection on synonymous DNA mutations is investigated by comparing the evolutionary dynamics of these two categories of silent DNA changes. Sequences from outgroups are used to determine the direction of synonymous DNA changes within and between D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans for five genes. Population genetics theory shows that differences in the fitness effect of mutations can be inferred from the comparison of ratios of polymorphism to divergence. Unpreferred changes show a significantly higher ratio of polymorphism to divergence than preferred changes in the D. simulans lineage, confirming the action of selection at silent sites. An excess of unpreferred fixations in 28 genes suggests a relaxation of selection on synonymous mutations in D. melanogaster. Estimates of selection coefficients for synonymous mutations (3.6 < \N(e)s\ < 1.3) in D. simulans are consistent with the reduced efficacy of natural selection (\N(e)s\ < 1) in the threeto sixfold smaller effective population size of D. melanogaster. Synonymous DNA changes appear to be a prevalent class of weakly selected mutations in Drosophila.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) is a powerful technology for measuring global gene expression, through rapid generation of large numbers of transcript tags. Beyond their intrinsic value in differential gene expression analysis, SAGE tag collections afford abundant information on the size and shape of the sample transcriptome and can accelerate novel gene discovery. These latter SAGE applications are facilitated by the enhanced method of Long SAGE. A characteristic of sequencing-based methods, such as SAGE and Long SAGE is the unavoidable occurrence of artifact sequences resulting from sequencing errors. By virtue of their low-random incidence, such tag errors have minimal impact on differential expression analysis. However, to fully exploit the value of large SAGE tag datasets, it is desirable to account for and correct tag artifacts. Results: We present estimates for occurrences of tag errors, and an efficient error correction algorithm. Error rate estimates are based on a stochastic model that includes the Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing error contributions. The correction algorithm, SAGEScreen, is a multi-step procedure that addresses ditag processing, estimation of empirical error rates from highly abundant tags, grouping of similar-sequence tags and statistical testing of observed counts. We apply SAGEScreen to Long SAGE libraries and compare error rates for several processing scenarios. Results with simulated tag collections indicate that SAGEScreen corrects 78\% of recoverable tag errors and reduces the occurrences of singleton tags. },

  Abstract                 = {Many technologies have been developed to help explain the function of genes discovered by systematic genome sequencing. At present, transcriptome and proteome studies dominate large-scale functional analysis strategies. Yet the metabolome, because it is 'downstream', should show greater effects of genetic or physiological changes and thus should be much closer to the phenotype of the organism. We earlier presented a functional analysis strategy that used metabolic fingerprinting to reveal the phenotype of silent mutations of yeast genes(1). However, this is difficult to scale up for high-throughput screening. Here we present an alternative that has the required throughput (2 min per sample). This 'metabolic footprinting' approach recognizes the significance of 'overflow metabolism' in appropriate media. Measuring intracellular metabolites is time-consuming and subject to technical difficulties caused by the rapid turnover of intracellular metabolites and the need to quench metabolism and separate metabolites from the extracellular space. We therefore focused instead on direct, noninvasive, mass spectrometric monitoring of extracellular metabolites in spent culture medium. Metabolic footprinting can distinguish between different physiological states of wildtype yeast and between yeast single-gene deletion mutants even from related areas of metabolism. By using appropriate clustering and machine learning techniques, the latter based on genetic programming(2-8), we show that metabolic footprinting is an effective method to classify 'unknown' mutants by genetic defect.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent availability of heterogeneous high-throughput data types has increased the need for scalable in silico methods with which to integrate data related to the processes of regulation, protein synthesis, and metabolism. A sequence-based framework for modeling transcription and translation in prokaryotes has been established and has been extended to study the expression state of the entire \emph{{E}scherichia coli} genome. The resulting in silico analysis of the expression state highlighted three facets of gene expression in \emph{{E}.~coli}: (i) the metabolic resources required for genome expression and protein synthesis were found to be relatively invariant under the conditions tested; (ii) effective promoter strengths were estimated at the genome scale by using global {mRNA} abundance and half-life data, revealing genes subject to regulation under the experimental conditions tested; and (iii) large-scale genome location-dependent expression patterns with approximately 600-kb periodicity were detected in the \emph{{E}.~coli} genome based on the 49 expression data sets analyzed. These results support the notion that a structured model-driven analysis of expression data yields additional information that can be subjected to commonly used statistical analyses. The integration of heterogeneous genome-scale data (i.e., sequence, expression data, and {mRNA} half-life data) is readily achieved in the context of an in silico model.},

In tRNA(Val), these modifications allow all four nucleotides to be successfully read at the wobble position in a codon. Previous data suggest that entropic effects are mainly responsible for the extended reading capabilities, but detailed mechanisms have remained unknown. We have performed a wide range of simulations to elucidate the details of these mechanisms at the atomic level and quantify their effects: extensive free energy perturbation coupled with umbrella sampling, entropy calculations of tRNA ( free and bound to the ribosome), and thorough structural analysis of the ribosomal decoding center. No prestructuring effect on the tRNA anticodon stem-loop from the two modifications could be observed, but we identified two mechanisms that may contribute to the expanded decoding capability by the modifications: The further reach of the cmo(5)U34 allows an alternative outer conformation to be formed for the noncognate base pairs, and the modification results in increased contacts between tRNA, mRNA, and the ribosome.},

In contrast to conventional wisdom, it shows that the predominant virus variant does not necessarily have the highest replication rate. A strong immune response produces a selective advantage for latent viruses, whereas a deteriorating immune response invites in viruses of higher replication rates. The model is analysed in light of the well-studied HIV/AIDS disease progression, and shows how a wide range of major, seemingly unrelated issues in the study of HIV may be accounted for in a simple and unified manner.},

Antibiotics have saved millions of lives and have also brought a revolution in medicine. However, an increasing threat has deteriorated the effectiveness of these drugs, that of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, which is defined here as the ability of bacteria to survive in antibiotic concentrations that inhibit! kill others of the same species. In this review some recent and important examples of resistance in pathogens of concern for mankind are mentioned. It is explained, according to present knowledge, the process that led to the current situation in a short time, evolutionarily speaking. It begins with the resistance genes, continues with clones and genetic elements involved in the maintenance and dissemination, and ends with other factors that contribute to its spread. Possible responses to the problem are also reviewed, with special reference to the development of new antibiotics.

Sorting the data according to the eigengenes and eigenarrays gives a global picture of the dynamics of gene expression, in which individual genes and arrays appear to be classified into groups of similar regulation and function, or similar cellular state and biological phenotype, respectively. After normalization and sorting, the significant eigengenes and eigenarrays can be associated with observed genome-wide effects of regulators, or with measured samples, in which these regulators are overactive or underactive, respectively.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

Mussels were reared for 22 months, between December 1994 and October 1996, in 1-L experimental chambers supplied with natural seston. Growth in shell length, individual wet mass and ash free dry mass (m) decreased with decreasing food availability and increasing population density. Survival was negatively correlated with density but did not differ significantly between food regimes during the first year. Variations in concentration of available food did not alter the effects of crowding on mussels, as judged from the slopes of the body size-density curves. The general patterns exhibited by B-N curves were not consistent with expectations since we found 1) no classical competition-density (C-D) effect as reported in plants at intermediate competition levels, and 2) a slope of -0.648 for m-N curves in both food regimes, which was higher than expected from self-thinning (ST) theory. This value does not support present food-driven ST theory. This study introduces an unusual m-N region which combines properties of both ST and C-D effect.},

Most of these models have addressed specific pathways using either stoichiometric or flux-balance analysis, or fully kinetic Michaelis-Menten representations, metabolic control analysis, or biochemical systems theory. So far, the predictions of kinetic models have rarely been tested using direct experimentation. Here, we validate experimentally a biochemical systems theoretical model of sphingolipid metabolism in yeast. Simulations of metabolic fluxes, enzyme deletion and the effects of inositol (a key regulator of phospholipid metabolism) led to predictions that show significant concordance with experimental results generated post hoc. The model also allowed the simulation of the effects of acute perturbations in fatty-acid precursors of sphingolipids, a situation that is not amenable to direct experimentation. The results demonstrate that modelling now allows testable predictions as well as the design and evaluation of hypothetical 'thought experiments' that may generate new metabolomic approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Many decades of scientific investigation have proved the role of selective pressure in Homo Sapiens at least at the level of individual genes or loci. Nevertheless, there are examples of polygenic traits that are bound to be under selection, but studies devoted to apply population genetics methods to unveil such occurrence are still lacking. Stature provides a relevant example of well-studied polygenic trait for which is now available a genome-wide association study which has identified the genes involved in this trait, and which is known to be under selection. We studied the behavior of F(ST) in a simulated toy model to detect population differentiation on a generic polygenic phenotype under selection. The simulations showed that the set of alleles involved in the trait has a higher mean FST value than those undergoing genetic drift only. In view of this we looked for an increase in the mean FST value of the 180 variants associated to human height. For this set of alleles we found F(ST) to be significantly higher than the genomic background (p = 0.0356). On the basis of a statistical analysis we excluded that the increase was just due to the presence of outliers. We also proved as marginal the role played by local adaptation phenomena, even on different phenotypes in linkage disequilibrium with genetic variants involved in height. The increase of F(ST) for the set of alleles involved in a polygenic trait seems to provide an example of symmetry breaking phenomenon concerning the population differentiation. The splitting in the allele frequencies would be driven by the initial conditions in the population dynamics which are stochastically modified by events like drift, bottlenecks, etc, and other stochastic events like the born of new mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic differences both between individuals and populations are studied for their evolutionary relevance and for their potential medical applications. Most of the genetic differentiation among populations are caused by random drift that should affect all loci across the genome in a similar manner. When a locus shows extraordinary high or low levels of population differentiation, this may be interpreted as evidence for natural selection. The most used measure of population differentiation was devised by Wright and is known as fixation index, or F(ST). We performed a genome-wide estimation of F(ST) on about 4 millions of SNPs from HapMap project data. We demonstrated a heterogeneous distribution of F(ST) values between autosomes and heterochromosomes. When we compared the F(ST) values obtained in this study with another evolutionary measure obtained by comparative interspecific approach, we found that genes under positive selection appeared to show low levels of population differentiation. We applied a gene set approach, widely used for microarray data analysis, to detect functional pathways under selection. We found that one pathway related to antigen processing and presentation showed low levels of F(ST), while several pathways related to cell signalling, growth and morphogenesis showed high F(ST) values. Finally, we detected a signature of selection within genes associated with human complex diseases. These results can help to identify which process occurred during human evolution and adaptation to different environments. They also support the hypothesis that common diseases could have a genetic background shaped by human evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay (NMD) is triggered by premature translation termination(1-3), but the features distinguishing premature from normal termination are unknown. One model for NMD suggests that decay-inducing factors bound to {mRNA}s during early processing events are routinely removed by elongating ribosomes but remain associated with {mRNA}s when termination is premature, triggering rapid turnover(4). Recent experiments(5-7) challenge this notion and suggest a model that posits that {mRNA} decay is activated by the intrinsically aberrant nature of premature termination(8,9). Here we use a primer extension inhibition ( toeprinting) assay(10) to delineate ribosome positioning and find that premature translation termination in yeast extracts is indeed aberrant. Ribosomes encountering premature UAA or UGA codons in the CAN1 {mRNA} fail to release and, instead, migrate to upstream AUGs. This anomaly depends on prior nonsense codon recognition and is eliminated in extracts derived from cells lacking the principal NMD factor, Upf1p, or by flanking the nonsense codon with a normal 3' - untranslated region (UTR). Tethered poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p), used as a mimic of a normal 3'-UTR, recruits the termination factor Sup35p (eRF3) and stabilizes nonsense-containing {mRNA}s. These findings indicate that efficient termination and {mRNA} stability are dependent on a properly configured 3'-UTR. },

Deterministic compartment analysis has been performed based on Jeger's linked differential equations. Some important, well-established epidemiological principles and concepts have been 'rediscovered', clarified or redefined. A new variable, defined as total inoculum reservoir of the host, is suggested as an additional epidemiological concept. Three rate parameters with phytopathological meaning were included in the system: R the constant intrinsic infection rate comparable to the Vanderplankian R(c), h pathogen's 'hatching rate', related to the mean latent period p and g the intrinsic removal rate related to the infectious period i. Another parameter lambda(1) is empirical and comparable to the logarithmic infection rate, sensu Vanderplank if time becomes very large. In the compartment system iR = 0 is a threshold condition for total disease to increase over initial disease level and iR = 1 is a threshold condition for an 'explosive' total disease increase that may induce a large epidemic rather than a threshold for total disease to start or to exist. When iR < 1, the total disease level approaches a asymptotically, a finite value, while when iR > 1, the total disease increase is explosive; only where lambda, = root dh does this increase follows the exponential law at larger t, otherwise the exponential law with the same rate parameter lambda(1) underestimates or overestimates the amount of total disease at any time t. Some further implications are discussed and compared with those derived from the Vanderplankian system of epidemiological analysis. }

A second-order Runge-Kulta method for numerical integration of the system of differential equations was used to solve the equations. Total and postsporulating disease progress curves are S-shaped while latent and infectious disease progress in the form of optimum curves. The curve of a composite variable defined as total (latent and infectious) inoculum reservoir of the host progresses also in the form of an optimum curve showing a maxi at the total disease level y(t)/K = 1 - 1/iR, where K is the total population of infection sites, i is the infectious period, R the intrinsic infection rate and iR greater than or equal to 1/(1 - y(0)/K). The size of this maxi is a monotone increasing function of the product iR by given initial disease level y(0). Condition iR = 1/(1 - y(0)/K) is a threshold condition for total inoculum to increase every, or alternatively a threshold condition for a rapid disease increase at the start resulting, possibly, in a large epidemic. Condition iR = 0 is a threshold condition for total disease to increase over initial disease level. Total disease reaches an asymptotic value less than unity if and only if infectious period is finite (existence of removals). In the compartment system there is a consistency regarding the threshold conditions for total disease to increase over initial disease level in the cases with and without a density-dependent factor. Conversely, in the Vanderplankian system of differential-difference equation the threshold conditions are iR = 0 and iR = 1 respectively due to the assumption of an exponential increase of total disease early in the epidemic. The particular cases without latent period and without removals are treated separately. The implications derived from the compartment analysis are compared with those derived from the Vanderplankian system of epidemiologic analysis. }

  Abstract                 = {Background. Epidemiologists are often interested in estimating the risk of several related diseases as well as adverse outcomes, which have a natural ordering of severity or certainty. While most investigators choose to model several dichotomous outcomes (such as very low birthweight versus normal and moderately low birthweight versus normal), this approach does not fully utilize the available information. Several statistical models for ordinal responses have been proposed, but have been underutilized. In this paper, we describe statistical methods for modelling ordinal response data, and illustrate the fit of these models to a large database from a perinatal health programme. Methods. Models considered here include (1) the cumulative logit model, (2) continuation-ratio model, (3) constrained and unconstrained partial proportional odds models, (4) adjacent-category logit model, (5) polytomous logistic model, and (6) stereotype logistic model. We illustrate and compare the fit of these models on a perinatal database, to study the impact of midline episiotomy procedure on perineal lacerations during labour and delivery. Finally, we provide a discussion on graphical methods for the assessment of model assumptions and model constraints, and conclude with a discussion on the choice of an ordinal model. The primary focus in this paper is the formulation of ordinal models, interpretation of model parameters, and their implications for epidemiological research. Conclusions. This paper presents a synthesized review of generalized linear regression models for analysing ordered responses. We recommend that the analyst performs (i) goodness-of-fit tests and an analysis of residuals, (ii) sensitivity analysis by fitting and comparing different models, and (iii) by graphically examining the model assumptions.}

This success has led to this model being invoked to explain double-strand break (DSB) repair in other contexts. However, most non-crossover (NCO) recombinants generated during S. cerevisiae meiosis do not arise via a DSBR pathway. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that DSBR is a minor pathway for recombinational repair of DSBs that occur in mitotically-proliferating cells and that the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) model appears to describe mitotic DSB repair more accurately. Fundamental dissimilarities between meiotic and mitotic recombination are not unexpected, since meiotic recombination serves a very different purpose (accurate chromosome segregation, which requires COs) than mitotic recombination (repair of DNA damage, which typically generates NCOs).},

The test items are based on actual scientific studies of natural selection, whereas previous tests have employed hypothetical situations that were often misleading or oversimplified. The Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection (CINS) is a 20-item multiple choice test that employs common alternative conceptions as distractors. An original 12-item version of the test was field-tested with 170 nonmajors in 6 classes and 43 biology majors in 1 class at 3 community colleges. The test scores of one subset of nonmajors (n=7) were compared with the students' performances in semistructured interviews. There was a positive correlation between the test scores and the interview. scores. The current 20-item version of the CINS was field-tested with 206 students in a nonmajors' general biology course. The face validity, internal validity, reliability, and readability of the CINS are discussed. Results indicate that the CINS will be a valuable tool for instructors.

Variation in parasite load comes from variation in exposure. Second paper, May and Anderson 1978 looks at microparasites. See Fig 1. for a number of examples of the relationship between added mortality and parasite load, all examples have either an linear or accelerating relationship. In these models they assume that host mort. is a function of p load. Basic Model: Assumes linear relationship between added mort. and $P$ Model A: introduces various patterns of non-random parasite dist. Model B: uses different assumptions about the relationship between $\alpha$ and p load. Model C: Introduce density dep. parasite mortality. Basic Model: Parasite can regulate host pop so long as production of transmission stages $\lambda$ is greater than $\mu + \alpha + a$ where $\mu$ is the parasite mort. rate in the host, $\alpha$ is the added host mort rate per parasite and $a$ is the host's birth rate (which is assumed to be greater than the host's background mort. rate $b$) but the equilibrium is only neutrally stable. Slight changes in model assumptions lead to either stability or instability. Model A: Non-random parasite dispersion across hosts. Use negative bionomial where $k$ is the clumping parameter (larger $k$ less clumping, as $k \to \infty$, they recover the basic model). Derive relationship between $k$ and $E(p^2)$ in appendix. As $k\to 0$ then the parasite loses the ability to regulate the host population b/c it is aggretated in just a few individuals. Also, as $\alpha \uparrow$ the parasite also fails to regulate the host population, this is because there is a reduction in the mean infection load due to parasite induced mort. As $k \downarrow$ apparently system stability increases also requires parasites with much greater $\lambda$ values. Interestingly they remark that "a rather broad generalization i[t] appears to be widely accepted in the parasitological literature that themajoirty of protozoan and helminth parasite sd do not cause the death of many hosts in natural ppulations. Yet they argue that laboratory data contrdicts this belief, esp. in inverts. Underdispersion, i.e. more uniform than poisson, always lead to unstable equilibrium. Model B: Nonlinear parasite induced mortalities. Assume accel. relationship between $\alpha$ and p load. Generally tends to increase the ecological stability of the equilibrium, including cases of underdispersion, while at the same time decreasing the parameter space in which an equil. exists. Model C: Density dep. parasite pop. growth. Assume due to immune response or intrasp. competition within a host. Present data of helminth mort on vert. host vs. p load in figure 8. Similar results to model B. State you get the same general results if instead dens. dep. acts through parasite repro. rate. Note linear relationships between trans and added mort. (via p load) can lead to ecologically stable systems if overdispersed (but evolutionarily unstable since ns will favor ever increasing values of $\alpha$}

Use the idea of an epidedmic threshold, but not $R_0$ (see notes from M\&A 1983 for $R_0$ Start of by discussing laboratory systems where a sporozoan have been shown to affect population density of Tribolium and even reverse competitive outcome b/w two Tr. spp. (seePark (1948)). Diseases have been cited as important mortality factors in wild mammals and birds. Gives the example of bighorn sheep and lungworm infections, rinderpest a pandemic in the late 1800s and african artiodactyls. Data analyzed in model comes from mouse and the bacterium (Pasteurella muris) and a poxvirus ectromelia Equation/situation first analyzed assumes constant immigration rate $A$ into host population, thus at equilibrium $N^* = A/(\mu + \alpha)$ if disease can persist (drop $\alpha$ if it can't). Disease persistance is determined by whether or not $A\land mu >< \beta/(\alpha + \mu + \nu)$, if the $>$ holds then parasite should depress pop. size until $R_0 = 1$ or equivalently until $N^*$ given above holds (haven't checked). They, perhaps, produce a number of implicit parasite fitness landscapes. Looking at $N^*$ as theoretically predicted vs. $\alpha$, though it doesn't appear that they assume any trade off between $\alpha$ and $\beta$, it not clear how $N^*$ and $S^*$ are related but are highly likely to be correlated. They note: " the maxi. depression of hte host opo. is achieved by a disease of intermediate pathogenicity." and that the obs. $\alpha$ value is pretty close to the min. $N^*$ but don't really know what that means at this point. Now move on to theory where they ignore immigration, but allow host births to occur and try to address 3 main questions: (a) what biol. charact. of an infection determin its impact on host pop. growth, (b) what are the pop. conseq. of inmmuno. reponses, and (3) what cond. lead to endemic or epidemic infect? If disease can't reg. pop. it will still spread and all of the expon. growing hosts will either asymptotically approach being infect. or recovered. One problem with this model is the lack of units. For instance, in the section "Pop. conseq. of immune responses" they discuss a threshold density of 340,000, but don't mention units (implicit is that its around 7 more dense than the inital population density of 50,000, but again how that is set is unclear). Note: endemics are stable, persistant level of infection w/in a population while epidemics are unstable, rapid spread and then decline of an infection. Stochastic factors may be important in driving epidemic cycles, esp. in situations where the population growth rate is much less than the added mort. rate of the disease. Infection sweeps through, is essentially lost via stoch. events, population builds up to above threshold density, disease is eventually reintroduced, epidemic occurs, etc. If instead added mort and pop. growth are about equal then one expects the case of an endemic disease. "\ldots lit is important to remember that hosts with high rates of reproduction, such as arthrodpods, may be able to support endemic disease even if population density is low." }

The magnitude of this cost is the main biological parameter that influences the rate of development of resistance, the stability of the resistance and the rate at which the resistance might decrease if antibiotic use were reduced. These findings suggest that the fitness costs of resistance will allow susceptible bacteria to outcompete resistant bacteria if the selective pressure from antibiotics is reduced. Unfortunately, the available data suggest that the rate of reversibility will be slow at the community level. Here, we review the factors that influence the fitness costs of antibiotic resistance, the ways by which bacteria can reduce these costs and the possibility of exploiting them.},

  Abstract                 = {Virulence is an evolutionary paradox because parasites never benefit from their host's death. The adaptive explanation of virulence is classically based upon the existence of physiological constraints that create a trade-off between parasites' epidemiological traits (virulence, transmissibility, and clearance). Here we develop an epidemiological model where infections are dynamic processes and we demonstrate how these dynamics generate a trade-off between emerging epidemiological parameters. We then study how host's immune strength modifies this trade-off and hence influences virulence evolution. We found that in acute infections, where parasites are engaged in a race with immune cells, immunity restrains more the duration of the infection than its intensity. As a consequence parasites evolve to provoke more virulent but shorter infections in strongly immunized hosts.},

  Abstract                 = {An important aspect of microparasite biology is the fact that infections are populations of thousands of microbes. As any population, infections are hence subject to two main types of changes: demographic and evolutionary. Here we analyse the consequences of within-host evolutionary changes. We build an epidemiological model where infections are regularly invaded by locally favored mutations affecting various infectious traits (virulence, transmissibility and clearance). Our results are the following. In durable infections, where within-host evolution is an important matter, a drop of transmissibility is only slightly deleterious to the infection, while a reduction of infection lifespan is very costly. In consequence, locally favored mutations reducing transmissibility reach a larger frequency, or even the complete fixation, and the suboptimality accumulated in infections owing to within-host evolution affects more their transmission than their duration. Conversely, taking an infection at random and observing the events of within-host evolution, one is more likely to observe reductions of infection length than reductions of transmissibility, because the mutations affecting transmissibility are often already present in infections. We then discuss the interpretation of these results in terms of deleterious mutations, and we also emphasize that the management of within-host evolution could be used as a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of infection.},

  Abstract                 = {This review is motivated by the true explosion in the number of recent studies both developing and ameliorating probabilistic models of codon evolution. Traditionally parametric, the first codon models focused on estimating the effects of selective pressure on the protein via an explicit parameter in the maximum likelihood framework. Likelihood ratio tests of nested codon models armed the biologists with powerful tools, which provided unambiguous evidence for positive selection in real data. This, in turn, triggered a new wave of methodological developments. The new generation of models views the codon evolution process in a more sophisticated way, relaxing several mathematical assumptions. These models make a greater use of physicochemical amino acid properties, genetic code machinery, and the large amounts of data from the public domain. The overview of the most recent advances on modeling codon evolution is presented here, and a wide range of their applications to real data is discussed. On the downside, availability of a large variety of models, each accounting for various biological factors, increases the margin for misinterpretation; the biological meaning of certain parameters may vary among models, and model selection procedures also deserve greater attention. Solid understanding of the modeling assumptions and their applicability is essential for successful statistical data analysis.},

We present a framework for the R statistical computing language that provides a simple yet powerful programming interface to a computational cluster. This interface allows the development of R functions that distribute independent computations across the nodes of the computational cluster. The resulting framework allows statisticians to obtain significant speedups for some computations at little additional development cost. The particular implementation can be deployed in heterogeneous computing environments.},

New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population(1) and to generate subsequent humanto-human transmission(2). Effective human- to- human transmission requires that the pathogen's basic reproductive number, R-0, should exceed one, where R-0 is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population(3). However, an increase in R-0, even when insufficient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number of subsequently infected individuals. Here we show that, as a consequence of this, the probability of pathogen evolution to R-0 > 1 and subsequent disease emergence can increase markedly.}

  Abstract                 = {The concept of plant venereal disease is examined from definitional, operational and axiomatic viewpoints. The transmission of many plant pathogens occurs during the flowering phase and is effected either by pollinators or by wind dispersal of spores from inflorescences. Attraction of insects by pseudo-flowers or sugary secretions also serves to spread many diseases. Given the diversity of processes involved, a simple all-encompassing parallel with animal venereal diseases is not possible. Operationally establishing the routes of disease transmission, as well as quantifying the relative magnitudes of these different routes, remains critical for understanding disease dynamics and controlling spread in agricultural contexts. From an axiomatic viewpoint, sexually transmitted diseases are characterized by frequency-dependent transmission, transmission in the adult stage, and by virulence effects involving sterility rather than mortality. These characteristics serve to differentiate the dynamics and evolution of sexually transmitted diseases from that of other diseases and are features that are also shared by many pollinator-transmitted diseases. However, the majority of plant diseases that involve the reproductive structures show a rich biology that defies easy categorization. The experimental convenience of plants and their pathogens is likely to play an important role in understanding the evolution of disease traits, irrespective of what descriptive terms are applied to the natural history of the transmission process. },

  Abstract                 = {The need to prevent and cure emerging diseases often precludes their continuing study in situ. We present studies on the process of disease emergence by host shifts using the model system of anther-smut disease (Microbotryum violaceum) on the plant genus Silene (Caryophyllaceae). This system has little direct social impact, and it is readily amenable to experimental manipulation. Our microevolutionary studies have focused on the host shift of Microbotryum from Silene alba (= latifolia; white campion) onto Silene vulgaris (bladder campion) in a population in Virginia. Karyotypic variation shows that the host shift is recent and originates from the disease on sympatric S. alba. Analysis of the spatial pattern of disease shows that the host shift has been contingent on the co-occurrence of the two species at a local scale. Cross-inoculation studies show that families of the new host differ greatly in their susceptibility to the pathogen, indicating the potential for rapid evolution of resistance. Disease expression on the new host is frequently abnormal, suggesting that the pathogen is imperfectly adapted to its new host. In experimental populations, disease transmission within populations of the old host is greater than within populations of the new host. However, there is also a high transmission rate of the disease from the new host back to the old host, suggesting a feedback effect that increases disease prevalence in the community as a whole. Continuing studies of these populations are designed to determine whether this new host-pathogen system is likely to be self-sustaining and to quantify evolutionary changes in both the host and the pathogen. },

In the current study they compare two transmission modes: freq and dens. dependent. Model: Cost for resistance in terms of reduced birth rate. Resistance is a continuous trait. Continuous time model. Background mort. No recovery from infection. Density dependent birth rate (logisitic) Force of the infection is either prop. to freq. or density of infect. hosts. Find criteria for persistance of polymorphism at equilibrium, do stability analysis. They note that if one ignored host density effects such that the size of the population stayed constant then "It is straightforward to show that no polymorphic equilibrium exists under these conditions". Apparently this is similar to what Jayakar (1970) found. Discussion: "the expectation that hihgly resistant ind. should incur a correspondingly high cost to coexist with susceptibles is not borne out." This is because there is density dependent host growth and, therefore, the resistant hosts reduce the force of infection by diluting the suscept. population. Region of polymorphism becomes more restricted as the two genotypes become more similar in their suscept. "This is because the intro. of an alternative allele that differs only slightly in resistance has little effect on the disease incidence." It follows that one would expect to find extreme, rather than slight, differences in variation in natural populations which is apparently the case. Cite Kemper (1982) "It is interesting that the equilibrium numbers of diseased individual in the density-dependent transmission case is simply the cost-benefit ratio and independent of $\gamma$ (the degree of density-dependent population regulation)." They note that this finding is similar to that of Gillespie (1975). }

  Abstract                 = {Co-circulation of several strains of parasites has been observed in many host-parasite systems. However, simple epidemiological models cannot sustain this coexistence. In this work we study the coexistence of viral strains in the myxomatosis case. Myxomatosis, a highly lethal disease of the European rabbit, has been used in Australia and Europe as a biological control of rabbit populations. A few years after its introduction, the original highly virulent strains were almost completely replaced by field strains covering a wide range of virulence. Here, we study several mechanisms that may explain the field observations. First we considered spatial heterogeneity. The establishment of any strain over regions occupied by host populations may delay the spread of any superior competitive virus strain, producing global coexistence in the long term. On the other hand, sub-populations with different resistance levels in epidemiological contact, as observed in the field, can maintain several different virus strains co-circulating. The second class of mechanism introduces diversity among hosts of a local population sharing a territory. We considered different classes of host resistance to myxomatosis: belonging to a resistance class is a random fact. Host age-dependent resistance is also especially considered. These types of population heterogeneity can sustain local coexistence for many years, although exclusion takes place for long enough periods. The concurrent action of both types of mechanisms could explain why the diversity of virus strains is sustained, and the local coexistence. Finally, we briefly discuss the influence of host genetic dynamics in the coevolution of the system. }

Proteins are gene products, and at the level of genes, duplication, recombination, fusion and fission are the processes that produce new genes. We attempt to gain an overview of these processes by studying the evolutionary units in proteins, domains, in the protein sequences of 40 genomes. The domain and superfamily definitions in the Structural Classification of Proteins Database are used, so that we can view all pairs of adjacent domains in genome sequences in terms of their superfamily combinations. We find 783 out of the 859 superfamilies in SCOP in these genomes, and the 783 families occur in 1307 pairwise combinations. Most families are observed in combination with one or two other families, while a few families are very versatile in their combinatorial behaviour; 209 families do not make combinations with other families. This type of pattern can be described as a scale-free network. We also study the N to C-terminal orientation of domain pairs and domain repeats. The phylogenetic distribution of domain combinations is surveyed, to establish the extent of common and kingdom-specific combinations. Of the kingdom-specific combinations, significantly more combinations consist of families present in all three kingdoms than of families present in one or two kingdoms. Hence, we are led to conclude that recombination between common families, as compared to the invention of new families and recombination among these, has also been a major contribution to the evolution of kingdom-specific and species-specific functions in organisms in all three kingdoms. Finally, we compare the set of the domain combinations in the genomes to those in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, and discuss the implications for structural genomics.},

Such strand bias in genomes, frequently visualized by GC skew graphs, is used for the computational prediction of transcription start sites and replication origins, as well as for comparative evolutionary genomics studies. The use of measures of compositional strand bias in order to quantify the degree of strand asymmetry is crucial, as it is the basis for determining the applicability of compositional analysis and comparing the strength of the mutational bias in different biological machineries in various species. Here, we review the measures of strand bias that have been proposed to date, including the Delta GC skew, the B-1 index, the predictability score of linear discriminant analysis for gene orientation, the signal-to-noise ratio of the oligonucleotide bias, and the GC skew index. These measures have been predominantly designed for and applied to the analysis of replication-related mutational processes in prokaryotes, but we also give research examples in eukaryotes. },

  Abstract                 = {Translation of an {mRNA} is generally divided into three stages: initiation, elongation and termination. The relative rates of these steps determine both the number and position of ribosomes along the {mRNA}, but traditional velocity sedimentation assays for the translational status of {mRNA} determine only the number of bound ribosomes. We developed a procedure, termed Ribosome Density Mapping (RDM), that uses site-specific cleavage of polysomal {mRNA} followed by separation on a sucrose gradient and northern analysis, to determine the number of ribosomes associated with specified portions of a particular {mRNA}. This procedure allows us to test models for translation and its control, and to examine properties of individual steps of translation \emph{in vivo}. We tested specific predictions from the current model for translational control of GCN4 expression in yeast and found that ribosomes were differentially associated with the uORFs elements and coding region under different growth conditions, consistent with this model. We also mapped ribosome density along the ORF of several {mRNA}s, to probe basic kinetic properties of translational steps in yeast. We found no detectable decline in ribosome density between the 5' and 3' ends of the ORFs, suggesting that the average processivity of elongation is very high. Conversely, there was no queue of ribosomes at the termination site, suggesting that termination is not very slow relative to elongation and initiation. Finally, the RDM results suggest that less frequent initiation of translation on {mRNA}s with longer ORFs is responsible for the inverse correlation between ORF length and ribosomal density that we observed in a global analysis of translation. These results provide new insights into eukaryotic translation \emph{in vivo}. },

For most genes, the majority of {mRNA} molecules were associated with ribosomes and presumably engaged in translation. This systematic approach enabled us to recognize genes with unusual behavior. For 43 genes, most {mRNA} molecules were not associated with ribosomes, suggesting that they may be translationally controlled. For 53 genes, including GCN4, CPA1, and ICY2, three genes for which translational control is known to play a key role in regulation, most {mRNA} molecules were associated with a single ribosome. The number of ribosomes associated with {mRNA}s increased with increasing length of the putative protein-coding sequence, consistent with longer transit times for ribosomes translating longer coding sequences. The density at which ribosomes were distributed on each {mRNA} (i.e., the number of ribosomes per unit ORF length) was well below the maximum packing density for nearly all {mRNA}s, consistent with initiation as the rate-limiting step in translation. Global analysis revealed an unexpected correlation: Ribosome density decreases with increasing ORF length: Models to account for this surprising observation are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {We simulate a deterministic population genetic model for the coevolution of genetic codes and protein-coding genes. We use very simple assumptions about translation, mutation, and protein fitness to calculate mutation-selection equilibria of codon frequencies and fitness in a large asexual population with a given genetic code. We then compute the fitnesses of altered,genetic codes that compete to invade the population by translating its genes with higher fitness. Codes and genes coevolve in a succession of stages, alternating between genetic equilibration and code invasion, from an initial wholly ambiguous coding state to a diversified frozen coding state. Our simulations almost always resulted in partially redundant frozen genetic codes. Also, the range of simulated physicochemical properties among encoded amino acids in frozen codes was always less than maximal. These results did not require the assumption of historical constraints on the number and type of amino acids available to codes nor on the complexity of proteins, stereochemical constraints on the translational apparatus, nor mechanistic constraints on genetic code change. Both the extent and timing of amino-acid diversification in genetic codes were strongly affected by the message mutation rate and strength of missense selection. Our results suggest that various omnipresent phenomena that distribute codons over sites with different selective requirements-such as the persistence of nonsynonymous mutations at equilibrium, the positive selection of the same codon in different types of sites, and translational ambiguity-predispose the evolution of redundancy and of reduced amino acid diversity in genetic codes.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomic evolution can be highly heterogeneous. Here, we introduce a new framework to simulate genome-wide sequence evolution under a variety of substitution models that may change along the genome and the phylogeny, following complex multispecies coalescent histories that can include recombination, demographics, longitudinal sampling, population subdivision/species history, and migration. A key aspect of our simulation strategy is that the heterogeneity of the whole evolutionary process can be parameterized according to statistical prior distributions specified by the user. We used this framework to carry out a study of the impact of variable codon frequencies across genomic regions on the estimation of the genome-wide nonsynonymous/synonymous ratio. We found that both variable codon frequencies across genes and rate variation among sites and regions can lead to severe underestimation of the global dN/dS values.

  Abstract                 = {Despite intense work, incorporating constraints on protein native structures into the mathematical models of molecular evolution remains difficult, because most models and programs assume that protein sites evolve independently, whereas protein stability is maintained by interactions between sites. Here, we address this problem by developing a new mean-field substitution model that generates independent site-specific amino acid distributions with constraints on the stability of the native state against both unfolding and misfolding. The model depends on a background distribution of amino acids and one selection parameter that we fix maximizing the likelihood of the observed protein sequence. The analytic solution of the model shows that the main determinant of the site-specific distributions is the number of native contacts of the site and that the most variable sites are those with an intermediate number of native contacts. The mean-field models obtained, taking into account misfolded conformations, yield larger likelihood than models that only consider the native state, because their average hydrophobicity is more realistic, and they produce on the average stable sequences for most proteins. We evaluated the mean-field model with respect to empirical substitution models on 12 test data sets of different protein families. In all cases, the observed site-specific sequence profiles presented smaller Kullback-Leibler divergence from the mean-field distributions than from the empirical substitution model. Next, we obtained substitution rates combining the mean-field frequencies with an empirical substitution model. The resulting mean-field substitution model assigns larger likelihood than the empirical model to all studied families when we consider sequences with identity larger than 0.35, plausibly a condition that enforces conservation of the native structure across the family. We found that the mean-field model performs better than other structurally constrained models with similar or higher complexity. With respect to the much more complex model recently developed by Bordner and Mittelmann, which takes into account pairwise terms in the amino acid distributions and also optimizes the exchangeability matrix, our model performed worse for data with small sequence divergence but better for data with larger sequence divergence. The mean-field model has been implemented into the computer program Prot_Evol that is freely available at http://ub.cbm.uam.es/software/Prot_Evol.php.},

These findings suggest that encouraging students to work in small groups and improving feedback between the instructor and the students can help to improve student outcomes even in very large classes. These results should be viewed cautiously, however, until this experiment can be replicated with additional faculty.

ParameciumDB currently supports browsing of phenotypes, alleles and stocks as well as querying of sequence features (genes, UniProt matches, InterPro domains, Gene Ontology terms) and of genetic data (phenotypes, stocks, RNA interference experiments). Forms allow submission of RNA interference data and some bioinformatics services are available.

  Abstract                 = {Background: The genome of Paramecium tetraurelia, a unicellular model that belongs to the ciliate phylum, has been shaped by at least 3 successive whole genome duplications (WGD). These dramatic events, which have also been documented in plants, animals and fungi, are resolved over evolutionary time by the loss of one duplicate for the majority of genes. Thanks to a low rate of large scale genome rearrangement in Paramecium, an unprecedented large number of gene duplicates of different ages have been identified, making this organism an outstanding model to investigate the evolutionary consequences of polyploidization. The most recent WGD, with 51\% of pre-duplication genes still in 2 copies, provides a snapshot of a phase of rapid gene loss that is not accessible in more ancient polyploids such as yeast. Results: We designed a custom oligonucleotide microarray platform for P. tetraurelia genome-wide expression profiling and used the platform to measure gene expression during 1) the sexual cycle of autogamy, 2) growth of new cilia in response to deciliation and 3) biogenesis of secretory granules after massive exocytosis. Genes that are differentially expressed during these time course experiments have expression patterns consistent with a very low rate of subfunctionalization (partition of ancestral functions between duplicated genes) in particular since the most recent polyploidization event. Conclusions: A public transcriptome resource is now available for Paramecium tetraurelia. The resource has been integrated into the ParameciumDB model organism database, providing searchable access to the data. The microarray platform, freely available through NimbleGen Systems, provides a robust, cost-effective approach for genome-wide expression profiling in P. tetraurelia. The expression data support previous studies showing that at short evolutionary times after a whole genome duplication, gene dosage balance constraints and not functional change are the major determinants of gene retention. },

  Abstract                 = {A problem common to biology and economics is the transfer of resources from parents to children. We consider the issue under the assumption that the number of offspring is unknown and can be represented as a random variable. There are 3 basic assumptions. The first assumption is that a given body of resources can be divided into consumption (yielding satisfaction) and transfer to children. The second assumption is that the parents' welfare includes a concern for the welfare of their children; this is recursive in the sense that the children's welfares include concern for their children and so forth. However, the welfare of a child from a given consumption is counted somewhat differently (generally less) than that of the parent (the welfare of a child is "discounted"). The third assumption is that resources transferred may grow (or decline). In economic language, investment, including that in education or nutrition, is productive. Under suitable restrictions, precise formulas for the resulting allocation of resources are found, demonstrating that, depending on the shape of the utility curve, uncertainty regarding the number of offspring may or may not favor increased consumption. The results imply that wealth (stock of resources) will ultimately have a log-normal distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Release of hemoglobin into plasma is a physiological phenomenon associated with intravascular hemolysis. In plasma, stable haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes are formed and these are subsequently delivered to the reticulo-endothelial system by CD163 receptor-mediated endocytosis. Heme arising from the degradation of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and of enzymes with heme prosthetic groups could be delivered in plasma. Albumin, haptoglobin, hemopexin, and high and low density lipoproteins cooperate to trap the plasma heme, thereby ensuring its complete clearance. Then hemopexin releases the heme into hepatic parenchymal cells only after internalization of the hemopexin-heme complex by CD91 receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, alpha(1)-microglobulin contributes to heme degradation by a still unknown mechanism, with the concomitant formation of heterogeneous yellow-brown kynurenine-derived chromophores which are very tightly bound to amino acid residues close to the rim of the lipocalin pocket. During hemoglobin synthesis, the erythroid alpha-chain hemoglobin-stabilizing protein specifically binds free alpha-hemoglobin subunits limiting the free protein toxicity. Although highly toxic because capable of catalyzing free radical formation, heme is also a major and readily available source of iron for pathogenic organisms. Gram-negative bacteria pick up the heme-bound iron through the secretion of a hemophore that takes up either free heme or heme bound to heme-proteins and transports it to a specific receptor, which, in turn, releases the heme and hence iron into the bacterium. Here, hemoglobin and heme trapping mechanisms are summarized.},

H. pylori has adapted to humans, colonizing children and persisting throughout life. Most strains possess factors that subtly modulate the host environment, increasing the risk of peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and possibly other diseases. H. pylori genes encoding these and other factors rapidly evolve through mutation and recombination, changing the bacteria-host interaction. Although immune and physiologic responses to H. pylori also contribute to pathogenesis, humans have evolved in concert with the bacterium, and its recent absence throughout the life of many individuals has led to new human physiological changes. These may have contributed to recent increases in esophageal adenocarcinoma and, more speculatively, other modern diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Mutants of translation components which compensate for both -1 and +1 frame-shift mutations showed the first evidence for framing malleability. Those compensatory mutants isolated in bacteria and yeast with altered tRNA or protein factors are reviewed here and are considered to primarily cause altered P-site realignment and not altered translocation. Though the first sequenced tRNA mutant which suppressed a +1 frameshift mutation had an extra base in its anticodon loop and led to a textbook "yardstick" model in which the number of anticodon bases determines codon size, this model has long been discounted, although not by all. Accordingly, the reviewed data suggest that reading frame maintenance and translocation are two distinct features of the ribosome. None of the -1 tRNA suppressors have anticodon loops with fewer than the standard seven nucleotides. Many of the tRNA mutants potentially affect tRNA bending and/or stability and can be used for functional assays, and one has the conserved C74 of the 3' CCA substituted. The effect of tRNA modification deficiencies on framing has been particularly informative. The properties of some mutants suggest the use of alternative tRNA anticodon loop stack conformations by individual tRNAs in one translation cycle. The mutant proteins range from defective release factors with delayed decoding of A-site stop codons facilitating P-site frameshifting to altered EF-Tu/EF1 alpha to mutant ribosomal largeand small-subunit proteins L9 and S9. Their study is revealing how mRNA slippage is restrained except where it is programmed to occur and be utilized.},

Adults chronically infected with hepatitis B virus remain a significant potential source of sexually transmitted hepatitis B. The purpose of this article is to review the recent literature relating to hepatitis B virus transmission with particular emphasis on sexual transmission and efforts to prevent spread. Recent findings the introduction of hepatitis 8 virus vaccine and the implementation of universal childhood vaccination for hepatitis B in some countries have led to a dramatic reduction in the number of children with chronic hepatitis B. However, recent reports suggest that we are not as successful in preventing infection by sexual transmission. It is clear that sexual transmission of hepatitis B virus is still widespread and is a major problem in certain high-risk groups such as men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, prisoners and sex workers. Significant problems remain with respect to education and vaccination within these groups. Summary Hepatitis B virus remains a major health burden but it is preventable by education and vaccination. Greater resources are required to expand vaccination to the at-risk, sexually active adult populations if the World Health Organization ideal of hepatitis B virus eradication is to be realized and the burden of hepatitis B virus-related morbidity and mortality contained. }

We identified complex regulatory landscapes consisting of enhancers that drive spatially complex developmental expression patterns. Analysis of mouse lines in which individual craniofacial enhancers had been deleted revealed significant alterations of craniofacial shape, demonstrating the functional importance of enhancers in defining face and skull morphology.

  Abstract                 = {The duplication of entire genomes has long been recognized as having great potential for evolutionary novelties, but the mechanisms underlying their resolution through gene loss are poorly understood. Here we show that in the unicellular eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia, a ciliate, most of the nearly 40,000 genes arose through at least three successive whole-genome duplications. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the most recent duplication coincides with an explosion of speciation events that gave rise to the P. aurelia complex of 15 sibling species. We observed that gene loss occurs over a long timescale, not as an initial massive event. Genes from the same metabolic pathway or protein complex have common patterns of gene loss, and highly expressed genes are over-retained after all duplications. The conclusion of this analysis is that many genes are maintained after whole-genome duplication not because of functional innovation but because of gene dosage constraints. },

  Abstract                 = {In yeast, inosine is found at the first position of the anticodon (position 34) of seven different isoacceptor {tRNA} species, while in \emph{Escherichia coli} it is present only in {tRNA}(Arg). The corresponding {tRNA} genes all have adenosine at position 34. Using as substrates \emph{in vitro} T7-runoff transcripts of 31 plasmids carrying each natural of synthetic {tRNA} gene harbouring an anticodon with adenosine 34, we have characterised a yeast enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine 34 to inosine 34. The homologous E. coli enzyme modifies adenosine 34 only in {tRNA}s with an arginine anticodon ACG. The base conversion occurs by a hydrolytic deamination-type reaction. This was determined by reversed phase high-pressure liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction product after \emph{in vitro} modification in [O-18]water. This newly characterised {tRNA}:adenosine 34 deaminase was partially purified from yeast. It has a molecular mass of approximately 75 kDa, and it does not require any cofactor, except magnesium ions, to deaminate adenosine 34 efficiently in {tRNA}. The observed dependence of the enzymatic reaction on magnesium ions probably reflects the need for a correct {tRNA} architecture. Enzymatic recognition of {tRNA} does not depend on the presence of any ''identity'' nucleoside other than adenosine 34. Likewise, the presence of pseudouridine 32 or 1-methyl-guanosine 37 in the anticodon loop does not interfere with inosine 34 biosynthesis. However, the efficacy of adenosine 34 to inosine 34 conversion depends on the nucleotide sequence of the anticodon loop and its proximal stem, the best {tRNA} substrates being those with a purine at position 35. Mutations that affect the size of the anticodon loop or one of several three-dimensional base-pairs abolish the capacity of the {tRNA} to be substrate for the yeast {tRNA}:adenosine 34 deaminase. Evidently, the activity of yeast {tRNA}:adenosine 34 deaminase depends more on the global structural feature (conformational stability/flexibility) of the L-shaped {tRNA} substrates than on the identity of any particular nucleotide other than adenosine 34. An apparent K-m of 2.3 nM for its natural substrate {tRNA}(Ser) (anticodon AGA) was measured. Altogether, these results suggest that a single enzyme can account for the presence of inosine 34 in all seven cytoplasmic A34-containing precursor {tRNA}s in yeast. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited},

These shared functional domains, however, are differentially shuffled among evolutionary lineages to produce an increasing number of domain architectures. Combined with duplication and adaptive evolution, domain shuffling is responsible for the great phenotypic complexity of higher eukaryotes. Although the domain-shuffling hypothesis is generally accepted, determining the molecular mechanisms that lead to domain shuffling and novel gene creation has been challenging, as sequence features accompanying the formation of known genes have been obscured by accumulated mutations. The growing availability of genome sequences and EST databases allows us to study the characteristics of newly emerged genes. Here we review recent genome-wide DNA and EST analyses, and discuss the three major molecular mechanisms of gene formation: (1) atypical spicing, both within and between genes, followed by adaptation, (2) tandem and interspersed segmental duplications, and (3) retrotransposition events. }

To investigate the biases, overlaps, and complementarities among these data, we have carried out an analysis of two high-throughput mass spectrometry (HMS)-based protein interaction data sets from budding yeast, comparing them to each other and to other interaction data sets. Our analysis reveals 198 interactions among 222 proteins common to both data sets, many of which reflect large multiprotein complexes. It also indicates that a "spoke" model that directly pairs bait proteins with associated proteins is roughly threefold more accurate than a "matrix" model that connects all proteins. In addition, we identify a large, previously unsuspected nucleolar complex of 148 proteins, including 39 proteins of unknown function. Our results indicate that existing large-scale protein interaction data sets are nonsaturating and that integrating many different experimental data sets yields a clearer biological view than any single method alone.},

  Abstract                 = {An adenine-rich cis element at the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of Pabp1 {mRNA} is able to inhibit translation of its own {mRNA}. Similar inhibition of translation of a reporter beta -galactosidase {mRNA} is observed when the adenine-rich auto regulatory sequence (ARS) is placed within the 5'-UTR of this {mRNA}. For this translational control the distance of the ARS from the 5' cap is not important. However, it determines the number of 40 S ribosomal subunits bound to the translationally arrested {mRNA}. Inhibition of {mRNA} translation by this regulatory sequence occurs at the step of joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the pre-initiation complex. Translational arrest of the ARS containing {mRNA} in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system in the presence of exogenous Pabp1 protects the 5'-flanking region of the ARS from nuclease digestion. This protection depends on the binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the {mRNA}. The size and the sequence of the nucleotide-protected fragment depends on the location of the ARS within the 5'-UTR. When the ARS is located at a distance of about 78 nucleotides from the 5' cap, a 40-nucleotide-long region adjacent to the ARS is protected. On the other hand, when the ARS is moved further away from the 5' cap to a distance of similar to 267 nucleotides, a 100-nucleotidelong region adjacent to the ARS is protected from nuclease digestion. Nuclease protection is attributed to the presence of one or more stalled 40 S ribosomal subunits near the Pabp1-bound ARS.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: In contrasting levels of gene expression between groups of SAGE libraries, the libraries within each group are often combined and the counts for the tag of interest summed, and inference is made on the basis of these larger 'pseudolibraries'. While this captures the sampling variability inherent in the procedure, it fails to allow for normal variation in levels of the gene between individuals within the same group, and can consequently overstate the significance of the results. The effect is not slight: between-library variation can be hundreds of times the within-library variation. Results: We introduce a beta-binomial sampling model that correctly incorporates both sources of variation. We show how to fit the parameters of this model, and introduce a test statistic for differential expression similar to a two-sample t-test.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Two major identifiable sources of variation in data derived from the Serial Analysis of Gene Expression ({SAGE}) are within-library sampling variability and between-library heterogeneity within a group. Most published methods for identifying differential expression focus on just the sampling variability. In recent work, the problem of assessing differential expression between two groups of {SAGE} libraries has been addressed by introducing a beta-binomial hierarchical model that explicitly deals with both of the above sources of variation. This model leads to a test statistic analogous to a weighted two-sample t-test. When the number of groups involved is more than two, however, a more general approach is needed. Results: We describe how logistic regression with overdispersion supplies this generalization, carrying with it the framework for incorporating other covariates into the model as a byproduct. This approach has the advantage that logistic regression routines are available in several common statistical packages. Conclusions: the described method provides an easily implemented tool for analyzing {SAGE} data that correctly handles multiple types of variation and allows for more flexible modelling. }

We present a model of HIV quasispecies competition, which describes the conditions of viral quasispecies coexistence under different immune system conditions. Our model incorporates both T and B cells responses, and we show that the role of B cells is important and additive to that of T cells. Simulations of coinfection (simultaneous infection) and superinfection (delayed secondary infection) scenarios in the early stages (days) and in the late stages of the infection (years) are in agreement with emerging molecular biology findings. The immune response induces a competition among similar phenotypes, leading to differentiation (quasispeciation), escape dynamics and complex oscillations of viral strain abundance. We found that the quasispecies dynamics after superinfection or coinfection has time scales of several months and becomes even slower when the immune system response is weak. Our model represents a general framework to study the speed and distribution of HIV quasispecies during disease progression, vaccination and therapy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = { Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957 is an important pathogen in Norwegian populations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. It can infect a wide range of salmonid host species, but on most the infections are probably ultimately limited by a host response. Generally, on Norwegian salmon stocks, infections grow unchecked until the host dies. On a Baltic salmon stock, originally from the Neva River, a host reaction is mounted, limiting parasite population growth on those fishes initially susceptible. Among rainbow trouts Oncorhynchus mykiss from the same stock and among full sib anadromous arctic char Salvelinus alpinus, both naturally resistant and susceptible individuals later mounting a host response can be observed. This is in contrast to an anadromous stock of brown trout Salmo trutta where only innately resistant individuals were found. A general feature of salmonid infections is the considerable variation of susceptibility between individual fish of the same stock, which appears genetic in origin. The parasite seems to be generally unable to reproduce on non-salmonids, and on cyprinids, individual behavioural mechanisms of the parasite may prevent infection. Transmission occurs directly through host contact, and by detached gyrodactylids and also from dead fishes. Relative importance of these routes and of different host species in the epidemiology of the disease is discussed with reference to laboratory experiments and existing knowledge concerning the host-parasite ecology.}

  Abstract                 = {Nonspatial theory on pathogen evolution generally predicts selection for maximal number of secondary infections, constrained only by supposed physiological trade-offs between pathogen infectiousness and virulence. Spread of diseases in human populations can, however, exhibit large scale patterns, underlining the need for spatially explicit approaches to pathogen evolution. Here, we show, in a spatial model where all pathogen traits are allowed to evolve independently, that evolutionary trajectories follow a single relationship between transmission and clearance. This trade-off relation is an emergent system property, as opposed to being a property of pathogen physiology, and maximizes outbreak frequency instead of the number of secondary infections. We conclude that spatial pattern formation in contact networks can act to link infectiousness and clearance during pathogen evolution in the absence of any physiological trade-off. Selection for outbreak frequency offers an explanation for the evolution of pathogens that cause mild but frequent infections. }

This utilized frameshifting provides a unique tool for studying reading frame control. Peptidyl-tRNA slippage has been invoked to explain many cases of programmed frameshifting. The present work extends this to other cases. When the A-site is unoccupied, the P-site tRNA can be repositioned forward with respect to mRNA (although repositioning in the minus direction is also possible). A kinetic model is presented for the influence of both, the cognate tRNAs competing for overlapping codons in A-site, and the stabilities of P-site tRNA:mRNA complexes in the initial and new frames. When the A-site is occupied, the P-site tRNA can be repositioned backward. Whether frameshifting will happen depends on the ability of the A-site tRNA to subsequently be repositioned to maintain physical proximity of the tRNAs. This model offers an alternative explanation to previously published mechanisms of programmed frameshifting, such as out-of-frame tRNA binding, and a different perspective on simultaneous tandem tRNA slippage.},

Female worm length was modelled by a function of worm age and total worm burden, while worm egg production (eggs per gram faeces per female worm) was modelled by a function of worm age and worm length. The model was then used to predict worm burdens observed in a trickle-infection experiment. The predicted worm burdens were much higher than those observed, suggesting that worm death rates were higher during the trickle infection. After increasing worm death rates to fit the observed worm burdens, female worm lengths and egg production in the trickle infection were predicted. At the medium-and high-dose rates, predicted worm lengths and, thus, egg production were lower than observed, while at the low-dose rate predicted egg production was too high. It appeared that in the trickle infections, total worm burden had less influence on observed female worm length and egg production than in the single infections.

ACS is based on a multiplexed overlapping mutagenesis primer design that saturates only the targeted gene region with single codon changes. We have used ACS to produce single amino-acid changes in small and large regions of the human tumor suppressor protein p53 to identify single amino-acid substitutions that can restore activity to inactive p53 found in human cancers. Single-tube reactions were used to saturate defined 30-nt regions with all possible codon changes. The same technique was used in 20 parallel reactions to scan the 600-bp fragment encoding the entire p53 core domain. Identification of several novel p53 cancer rescue mutations demonstrated the utility of the ACS approach. ACS is a fast, simple and versatile method, which is useful for protein structure-function analyses and protein design or evolution problems.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of quantitative characters depends on the frequencies of the alleles involved, yet these frequencies cannot usually be measured. Previous groups have proposed an approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits, based on an analogy with statistical mechanics. We present a modified version of that approach, which makes the analogy more precise and applies quite generally to describe the evolution of allele frequencies. We calculate explicitly how the macroscopic quantities (i.e., quantities that depend on the quantitative trait) depend on evolutionary forces, in a way that is independent of the microscopic details. We first show that the stationary distribution of allele frequencies under drift, selection, and mutation maximizes a certain measure of entropy, subject to constraints on the expectation of observable quantities. We then approximate the dynamical changes in these expectations, assuming that the distribution of allele frequencies always maximizes entropy, conditional on the expected values. When applied to directional selection on an additive trait, this gives a very good approximation to the evolution of the trait mean and the genetic variance, when the number of mutations per generation is sufficiently high (4N{micro} > 1). We show how the method can be modified for small mutation rates (4N{micro} [-&gt;] 0). We outline how this method describes epistatic interactions as, for example, with stabilizing selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Stability of the native state is an essential requirement in protein evolution and design. Here we investigated the interplay between chain length and stability constraints using a simple model of protein folding and a statistical study of the Protein Data Bank. We distinguish two types of stability of the native state: with respect to the unfolded state (unfolding stability) and with respect to misfolded configurations (misfolding stability). Several contributions to stability are evaluated and their correlations are disentangled through principal components analysis, with the following main results. (1) We show that longer proteins can fulfil more easily the requirements of unfolding and misfolding stability, because they have a higher number of native interactions per residue. Consistently, in longer proteins native interactions are weaker and they are less optimized with respect to non-native interactions. (2) Stability against misfolding is negatively correlated with the strength of native interactions, which is related to hydrophobicity. Hence there is a trade-off between unfolding and misfolding stability. This trade-off is influenced by protein length: less hydrophobic sequences are observed in very long proteins. (3) The number of disulfide bonds is positively correlated with the deficit of free energy stabilizing the native state. Chain length and the number of disulfide bonds per residue are negatively correlated in proteins with short chains and uncorrelated in proteins with long chains. (4) The number of salt bridges per residue and per native contact increases with chain length. We interpret these observations as an indication that the constraints imposed by unfolding stability are less demanding in long proteins and they are further reduced by the competing requirement for stability against misfolding. In particular, disulfide bonds appear to be positively selected in short proteins, whereas they evolve in an effectively neutral way in long proteins. },

  Abstract                 = {We adopt a model of inverse folding in which folding stability results from the combination of the hydrophobic effect with local interactions responsible for secondary structure preferences. Site-specific amino acid distributions can be calculated analytically for this model. We determine optimal parameters for the local interactions by fitting the complete inverse folding model to the site-specific amino acid distributions found in the Protein Data Bank. This procedure reduces drastically the influence on the derived parameters of the preference of different secondary structures for buriedness, which affects local interaction parameters determined through the standard approach based on amino acid propensities. The quality of the fit is evaluated through the likelihood of the observed amino acid distributions given the model and the Bayesian Information Criterion, which indicate that the model with optimal local interaction parameters is strongly preferable to the model where local interaction parameters are determined through propensities. The optimal model yields a mean correlation coefficient r = 0.96 between observed and predicted amino acid distributions. The local interaction parameters are then tested in threading experiments, in combination with contact interactions, for their capacity to recognize the native structure and structures similar to the native against unrelated ones. In a challenging test, proteins structurally aligned with the Mammoth algorithm are scored with the effective free energy function. The native structure gets the highest stability score in 100\% of the cases, a high recognition rate comparable to that achieved against easier decoys generated by gapless threading. We then examine proteins for which at least one highly similar template exists. In 61\% of the cases, the structure with the highest stability score excluding the native belongs to the native fold, compared to 60\% if we use local interaction parameters derived from the usual amino acid propensities and 52\% if we use only contact interactions. A highly similar structure is present within the five best stability scores in 82\%, 81916, and 76\% of the cases, for local interactions determined through inverse folding, through propensity, and set to zero, respectively. These results indicate that local interactions improve substantially the performances of contact free energy functions in fold recognition, and that similar structures tend to get high stability scores, although they are often not high enough to discriminate them from unrelated structures. This work highlights the importance to apply more challenging tests, as the recognition of homologous structures, for testing stability scores for protein folding.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Since thermodynamic stability is a global property of proteins that has to be conserved during evolution, the selective pressure at a given site of a protein sequence depends on the amino acids present at other sites. However, models of molecular evolution that aim at reconstructing the evolutionary history of macromolecules become computationally intractable if such correlations between sites are explicitly taken into account. Results: We introduce an evolutionary model with sites evolving independently under a global constraint on the conservation of structural stability. This model consists of a selection process, which depends on two hydrophobicity parameters that can be computed from protein sequences without any fit, and a mutation process for which we consider various models. It reproduces quantitatively the results of Structurally Constrained Neutral (SCN) simulations of protein evolution in which the stability of the native state is explicitly computed and conserved. We then compare the predicted site-specific amino acid distributions with those sampled from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The parameters of the mutation model, whose number varies between zero and five, are fitted from the data. The mean correlation coefficient between predicted and observed site-specific amino acid distributions is larger than < r > = 0.70 for a mutation model with no free parameters and no genetic code. In contrast, considering only the mutation process with no selection yields a mean correlation coefficient of < r > = 0.56 with three fitted parameters. The mutation model that best fits the data takes into account increased mutation rate at CpG dinucleotides, yielding < r > = 0.90 with five parameters. Conclusion: The effective selection process that we propose reproduces well amino acid distributions as observed in the protein sequences in the PDB. Its simplicity makes it very promising for likelihood calculations in phylogenetic studies. Interestingly, in this approach the mutation process influences the effective selection process, i. e. selection and mutation must be entangled in order to obtain effectively independent sites. This interdependence between mutation and selection reflects the deep influence that mutation has on the evolutionary process: The bias in the mutation influences the thermodynamic properties of the evolving proteins, in agreement with comparative studies of bacterial proteomes, and it also influences the rate of accepted mutations. },

Economies with recordkeeping exhibit a beneficially altered economic history where the risks of exchanging with strangers are substantially lessened. Our findings are consistent with prior assertions that complex and extensive reciprocity requires sophisticated memory to store information on past transactions. We offer insights on this research by scientifically demonstrating that reciprocity can be facilitated by information storage external to the brain. This is consistent with the archaeological record, which suggests that prehistoric transaction records and the invention of writing for recordkeeping were linked to increased complexity in human interaction.},

These densities are investigated by alternative distance measures and also at the interface of multiunit structures. Amino acids are divided into nine structural categories according to three secondary structure states and three solvent accessibility levels. To take account of amino acid abundance differences across protein structures, we normalize the observed density by the expected density defining a density index Solvent accessibility levels exert the predominant influence in determinations of the regular residue density. Explicitly, the regular density values vary approximately linearly with respect to solvent accessibility levels, the linearity parameters depending on the amino acid. The charge index reveals pronounced inequalities between lysine and arginine in their interactions with acidic residues. The aromatic density calculations in all structural categories parallel the regular density calculations, indicating that the aromatic residues are distributed as a random sample of all residues. Moreover, aromatic residues are found to be over-represented in the neighborhood of all amino acids. This result might be attributed to nucleation sites and protein stability being substantially associated with aromatic residues.}

Two types of products are formed, crossovers (CO) and gene conversions not associated with a crossover, also called noncrossovers (NCO). They result from the repair through differentiated pathways of a common initiating event, DNA double-strand breaks, formation of which is programmed during early meiotic prophase. In contrast to CO, little is known on the frequency, distribution, and regulation of NCO in mammals, mostly due to the technical challenge represented by their detection. However, the development of batch sperm-typing methods allowed for the detection of meiotic NCO products at meiotic recombination hotspots in human and mice. Several recent studies based on this technique demonstrated that mammalian CO hotspots are sites of recombination initiation and that the formation of CO and NCO has different genetic requirements. Here, we describe a method for detecting and characterizing CO and NCO, which has been applied to the analysis of the mouse Psmb9 recombination hotspot.},

In an attempt to study this phenomenon, a group of pony mares and their foals was maintained on a naturally contaminated pasture in southern Louisiana. Fecal egg counts (FEC) and numbers of infective third stage larvae (L-3) kg(-1) dry herbage were recorded biweekly during two time periods, from January 1986 through December 1988, and September 1996 through October 1997. A FEC rise occurred during the late summer-early autumn which preceded the peak of L-3 on pasture during the winter season. The numbers of cyathostome L-3 were reduced during the hottest months of the year due mainly to daily minimum temperatures above 18 degrees C, and in winter during short freezing spells when daily minimum temperatures dropped below 0 degrees C. Tilling of the pasture reduced the number of cyathostome L3 during the early winter months but this is an efficacious measure only if horses are given an effective anthelmintic treatment prior to being returned to pasture. The data collected suggest that parasite reduction in southern Louisiana is possible using a treatment program with treatment beginning at the end of September and continuing through the end of March.

  Abstract                 = {The degradation of the RpoS ($\sigma$(S)) subunit of RNA polymerase in \emph{{E}scherichia coli} is a prime example of regulated proteolysis in prokaryotes. RpoS turnover depends on ClpXP protease, the response regulator RssB, and a hitherto uncharacterized "turnover element" within RpoS itself. Here we localize the turnover element to a small element (around the crucial amino acid lysine-173) directly downstream of the promoter-recognizing region 2.4 in RpoS. Its sequence as well as its location identify the turnover element as a unique proteolysis-promoting motif. This element is shown to be a site of interaction with RssB. Thus, RssB is functionally unique among response regulators as a direct recognition factor in ClpXP-dependent RpoS proteolysis. Binding of RssB to RpoS is stimulated by phosphorylation of the RssB receiver domain, suggesting that environmental stress affects RpoS proteolysis by modulating RssB affinity for RpoS. Initial evidence indicates that lysine-173 in RpoS, besides being essential of RpoS proteolysis, may play a role in promoter recognition. Thus the same region in RpoS is crucial for proteolysis as well as for activity as a transcription factor.},

Here we present a population genetic analysis of Drosophila simulans based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing of multiple inbred lines and comparison of the resulting data to genome assemblies of the closely related species, D. melanogaster and D. yakuba. We discovered previously unknown, large-scale fluctuations of polymorphism and divergence along chromosome arms, and significantly less polymorphism and faster divergence on the X chromosome. We generated a comprehensive list of functional elements in the D. simulans genome influenced by adaptive evolution. Finally, we characterized genomic patterns of base composition for coding and noncoding sequence. These results suggest several new hypotheses regarding the genetic and biological mechanisms controlling polymorphism and divergence across the Drosophila genome, and provide a rich resource for the investigation of adaptive evolution and functional variation in D. simulans. },

  Abstract                 = {Humans and animals often become coinfected with pathogen strains that differ in virulence. The ensuing interaction between these strains can, in theory, be a major determinant of the direction of selection on virulence genes in pathogen populations. Many mathematical analyses of this assume that virulent pathogen lineages have a competitive advantage within coinfected hosts and thus predict that pathogens will evolve to become more virulent where genetically diverse infections are common. Although the implications of these studies are relevant to both fundamental biology and medical science, direct empirical tests for relationships between virulence and competitive ability are lacking. Here we use newly developed strain-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocols to determine the pairwise competitiveness of genetically divergent Plasmodium chabaudi clones that represent a wide range of innate virulences in their rodent host. We found that even against their background of widely varying genotypic and antigenic properties, virulent clones had a competitive advantage in the acute phase of mixed infections. The more virulent a clone was relative to its competitor, the less it suffered from competition. This result confirms our earlier work with parasite lines derived from a single clonal lineage by serial passage and supports the virulence-competitive ability assumption of many theoretical models. To the extent that our rodent model captures the essence of the natural history of malaria parasites, public health interventions which reduce the incidence of mixed malaria infections should have beneficial consequences by reducing the selection for high virulence.},

Using an epitope-tagged strain collection, we measured the half-life of > 3,750 proteins in the yeast proteome after inhibition of translation. By integrating our data with previous measurements of protein and {mRNA} abundance and translation rate, we provide evidence that many proteins partition into one of two regimes for protein metabolism: one optimized for efficient production or a second optimized for regulatory efficiency. Incorporation of protein half-life information into a simple quantitative model for protein production improves our ability to predict steady-state protein abundance values. Analysis of a simple dynamic protein production model reveals a remarkable correlation between transcriptional regulation and protein half-life within some groups of coregulated genes, suggesting that cells coordinate these two processes to achieve uniform effects on protein abundances. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis underscore the importance of an integrative approach to the complex interplay between protein degradation, transcriptional regulation, and other determinants of protein metabolism. },

A diverse range of recent research papers is relevant to this debate, and it is timely to bring them together. The absence of introns that are not self-splicing in prokaryotes and several other lines of evidence suggest an ancient eukaryotic origin for these introns, and the subsequent gain and loss of introns appears to be an ongoing process in many organisms. Some introns are now functionally important and there have been suggestions that invoke natural selection for the ancient and recent gain of introns, but it is also possible that fixation and loss of introns can occur in the absence of positive selection.},

  Abstract                 = {To initiate an adaptive immune response, T cells need to interact with dendritic cells (DCs), and the duration of these interactions plays an important role. In vitro and in vivo experiments have generally tried to estimate the required period of opportunity for T cell stimulation rather than the duration of individual T cell-DC interactions. Since the application of multi-photon microscopy (MPM) to living lymphoid tissues, the interactions between immune cells, as well as the duration thereof, can directly be observed in vivo. Indeed, long-lasting interactions between T cells and DCs were shown to be important for the onset of immune responses. However, because MPM imaging is typically restricted to experiments lasting 1 h, and because T cell-DC conjugates frequently move into and out of the imaged volume, it is difficult to estimate the true duration of interactions from MPM contact data. Here, we present a method to properly make such an estimate of (the average of) the distribution of contact durations. We validate the method by applying it to spatially explicit computer simulations where the true distribution of contact duration is known. Finally, we apply our analysis to a large experimental data set of T-DC contacts, and predict an average contact time of about three hours. However, we identify a mismatch between the experimental data and the model predictions, and investigate possible causes of the mismatch, including minor tissue drift during imaging experiments. We discuss in detail how future experiments can be optimized such that MPM contact data will be minimally affected by these factors. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. },

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive immunity is initiated by T cell recognition of foreign peptides presented on dendritic cells ( DCs) by major histocompatibility molecules. These interactions take place in secondary lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes ( LNs) and spleen, and hence the anatomical structure of these tissues plays a crucial role in the development of immune responses. Two-photon microscopy ( 2PM) imaging in LNs suggests that T cells walk in a consistent direction for several minutes, pause briefly with a regular period, and then take off in a new, random direction. Here, we construct a spatially explicit model of T cell and DC migration in LNs and show that all dynamical properties of T cells could be a consequence of the densely packed LN environment. By means of 2PM experiments, we confirm that the large velocity fluctuations of T cells are indeed environmentally determined rather than resulting from an intrinsic motility program. Our simulations further predict that T cells self-organize into microscopically small, highly dynamic streams. We present experimental evidence for the presence of such turbulent streams in LNs. Finally, the model allows us to estimate the scanning rates of DCs ( 2,000 different T cells per hour) and T cells ( 100 different DCs per hour).},

The generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity between them are essential building blocks in the evolution of complex regulatory networks. We study a theoretical model for the sequence evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The approach is based on biophysical models for the binding of transcription factors to DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift, and selection. Results: We show that the selection for factor binding generically leads to specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies at different positions of a binding site. We demonstrate the possibility of rapid adaptive evolution generating a new binding site for a given transcription factor by point mutations. The evolutionary time required is estimated in terms of the neutral ( background) mutation rate, the selection coefficient, and the effective population size. Conclusions: The efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on two joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and the promoter region must be long enough. These constraints on promoter architecture are indeed seen in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore, we analyse the adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal integration through binding cooperativity between different sites. Experimental tests of this picture involving the statistics of polymorphisms and phylogenies of sites are discussed.},

The results have varied between 10(5) and 10(8). It is suggested here that most of this disparity can be explained by a model that accounts for the population structure of the species. Thus it is assumed that weakly selected characters, like synonymous substitutions, are selectively fixed within individual lines or colonies but spread throughout tile population in an essentially neutral way when colonies replace one another. In this way, the effective population size that enters expressions for the codon bias will be that of an individual colony, which, if hitchhiking effects are considered, can be a very small number. The effective population size that appears together with the mutation rate in expressions for the synonymous diversity, on the other hand, will be related to the total number of colonies that make up the species and can be a very large number.}

  Abstract                 = {The synonymous divergence between \emph{Escherichia coli} and Salmonella typhimurium is explained in a model where there is a large variation between mutation rates at different nucleotide sites in the genome. The model is based on the experimental observation that spontaneous mutation rates can vary over several orders of magnitude at different sites in a gene. Such site-specific variation must be taken into account when studying synonymous divergence and will result in an apparent saturation below the level expected from an assumption of uniform rates. Recently, it has been suggested that codon preference in enterobacteria has a very large site-specific variation and that the synonymous divergence between different species, e.g., E. coli and Salmonella, is saturated. In the present communication it is shown that when site-specific variation in mutation rates is introduced, there is no need to invoke assumptions of saturation and a large variability in codon preference. The same rate variation will also bring average mutation rates as estimated from synonymous sequence divergence into numerical agreement with experimental values. }

When the complications due to different degeneracies and different association rate constants for the different {tRNA}-codon combinations are accounted for, recent data from the literature indicate that the predicted relations hold up very well: the {tRNA} levels correlate with codon frequencies in a way that would support a maximal growth rate. The relations can also be used to predict the association rate constant between an A-site codon and the cognate ternary complex. Ln the cases where they can be compared, the results agree reasonably well with experimental results from the literature. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited. },

  Abstract                 = {The codon bias in \emph{Escherichia coli} for all two-fold degenerate amino acids was studied as dependent on the context from the six bases in the nearest surrounding codons. By comparing the results in genes at different expression levels, effects that are due to differences in mutation rates can be distinguished from those that are due to selection. Selective effects on the codon bias is found mostly from the first neighbouring base in the 3' direction, while neighbouring bases further away influence mostly the mutational bias. In some cases it is also possible to identify specific molecular processes, repair or avoidance of frame shift, that lead to the context dependence of the bias. }

  Abstract                 = {RNA interference (RNAi) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression to control cell development and differentiation. In plants, insects and nematodes RNAi also functions as an innate defence response against viruses. Similarly, there is accumulating evidence that RNAi functions as an antiviral defence mechanism in mammalian cells. Viruses have evolved highly sophisticated mechanisms for interacting with the host cell machinery, and recent evidence indicates that this also involves RNAi pathways. The cellular RNAi machinery can inhibit virus replication, but viruses may also exploit the RNAi machinery for their own replication. In addition, viruses can encode proteins or RNA molecules that suppress existing RNAi pathways or trigger the silencing of specific host genes. Besides the natural interplay between RNAi and viruses, induced RNAi provides an attractive therapy approach for the fight against human pathogenic viruses. Here, we summarize the latest news on virus-RNAi interactions and RNAi based antiviral therapy. (c) 2006 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

Isochores can be partitioned in a small number of families that cover a range of GC levels (GC is the molar ratio of guanine+cytosine in DNA), which is narrow in cold-blooded vertebrates, but broad in warm-blooded vertebrates. This difference is essentially due to the fact that the GC-richest 10-15\% of the genomes of the ancestors of mammals and birds underwent two independent compositional transitions characterized by strong increases in GC levels. The similarity of isochore patterns across mammalian orders, on the one hand, and across avian orders, on the other, indicates that these higher GC levels were then maintained, at least since the appearance of ancestors of warm-blooded vertebrates. After a brief review of our current knowledge on the organization of the vertebrate genome, evidence will be presented here in favor of the idea that the generation and maintenance of the GC-richest isochores in the genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates were due to natural selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Elucidating how natural selection promotes local adaptation in interaction with migration, genetic drift and mutation is a central aim of evolutionary biology. While several conceptual and practical limitations are still restraining our ability to study these processes at the DNA level, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) offer several assets that make them unique candidates for this purpose. Yet, it is unclear what general conclusions can be drawn after 15 years of empirical research that documented MHC diversity in the wild. The general objective of this review is to complement earlier literature syntheses on this topic by focusing on MHC studies other than humans and mice. This review first revealed a strong taxonomic bias, whereby many more studies of MHC diversity in natural populations have dealt with mammals than all other vertebrate classes combined. Secondly, it confirmed that positive selection has a determinant role in shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity in MHC genes in all vertebrates studied. Yet, future tests of positive selection would greatly benefit from making better use of the increasing number of models potentially offering more statistical rigour and higher resolution in detecting the effect and form of selection. Thirdly, studies that compared patterns of MHC diversity within and among natural populations with neutral expectations have reported higher population differentiation at MHC than expected either under neutrality or simple models of balancing selection. Fourthly, several studies showed that MHC-dependent mate preference and kin recognition may provide selective factors maintaining polymorphism in wild outbred populations. However, they also showed that such reproductive mechanisms are complex and context-based. Fifthly, several studies provided evidence that MHC may significantly influence fitness, either by affecting reproductive success or progeny survival to pathogens infections. Overall, the evidence is compelling that the MHC currently represents the best system available in vertebrates to investigate how natural selection can promote local adaptation at the gene level despite the counteracting actions of migration and genetic drift. We conclude this review by proposing several directions where future research is needed.}

Our results, which argue that decay of some \emph{{E}.~coli} {mRNA}s \emph{in vivo} depends on the action of assembled degradosomes, whereas others are acted on by degradosome proteins functioning independently of the complex, imply the existence of structural features or biochemical factors that target specific classes of {mRNA}s for decay by degradosomes.},

  Abstract                 = {The eukaryotic 40S ribosomal subunit locates the translation initiation codon on an {mRNA} via the so-called scanning process that follows 40S binding to the capped 5' end. This key step in translation is required for the expression of almost all eukaryotic genes, yet the mechanism and dynamics of scanning are unknown. We have performed quantitative studies \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro} of the movement of yeast 40S ribosomes along 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of different lengths. 40S subunits perform cap-dependent scanning with high processivity for more than 1700 nucleotides in cells of \emph{{S}accharomyces cerevisiae}. Moreover, the observed rates of expression indicate that scanning is performed by an untethered 40S subunit that has been released from the 5' cap complex. Unexpectedly, the capability to maintain scanning competence on a long 5' UTR is more dependent on the Ded1/Dbp1 type of helicase than on eIF4A or eIF4B. In a yeast cell-free extract, scanning shows reduced processivity, with an estimated net 5'-->3' rate of approximately 10 nucleotides per second at 26degreesC. We have developed a biased bidirectional walking model of ribosomal scanning that provides a framework for understanding the above observations as well as other known quantitative and qualitative features of this process.},

We elucidate variations between different spatial cell compartments and functional modules by comparing protein-to-{mRNA} ratios, translational activity, and a novel descriptor for protein-specific degradation (protein half-life descriptor). This analysis helps to understand the cell's strategy to use transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms for managing protein levels. For instance, it is possible to identify modules that are subject to suppressed translation under normal conditions ("translation on demand"). In order to reduce inconsistencies between the datasets, we compiled a new reference {mRNA} abundance dataset and we present a novel approach to correct large microarray signals for a saturation bias. Accounting for ribosome density based on transcript length rather than ORF length improves the correlation of observed protein levels to translational activity. We discuss potential causes for the deviations of these correlations. Finally, we introduce a quantitative descriptor for protein degradation (protein half-life descriptor) and compare it to measured half-lives. The study demonstrates significant post-transcriptional control of protein levels for a number of different compartments and functional modules, which is missed when exclusively focusing on transcript levels. },

The shape of these size distributions reflects mechanisms of protein complex association and dissociation. Results: We present the most simple dynamic model that is able to reproduce the observed protein complex size distribution for yeast. This protein association-dissociation model (PAD-model) simulates the dynamics of protein complex formation on a genomic scale for about 50 million protein molecules. By ruling out different model variants it is possible to elucidate fundamental features of the protein complex dynamics, e.g. complex association is independent of complex size. In addition, the PAD-model provides information about the complexity of the yeast proteome and it gives an idea of how many complexes could not be identified during the measurements. },

  Abstract                 = {This study presents compelling evidence that recombination significantly increases the silent GC content of a genome in a selectively neutral manner, resulting in a highly significant positive correlation between recombination and "GC3s" in the yeast \emph{{S}accharomyces cerevisiae}. Neither selection nor mutation can explain this relationship. A highly significant GC-biased mismatch repair system is documented for the first time in any member of the Kingdom Fungi. Much of the variation in the GC3s within yeast appears to result from GC-biased gene conversion. Evidence suggests that GC-biased mismatch repair exists in numerous organisms spanning six kingdoms. This transkingdom GC mismatch repair bias may have evolved in response to a ubiquitous AT mutational bias. A significant positive correlation between recombination and GC content is found in many of these same organisms, suggesting that the processes influencing the evolution of the yeast genome may be a general phenomenon. Nonrecombining regions of the genome and nonrecombining genomes would not be subject to this type of molecular drive. It is suggested that the low GC content characteristic of many nonrecombining genomes may be the result of three processes (1) a prevailing AT mutational bias, (2) random fixation of the most common types of mutation, and (3) the absence of the GC-biased gene conversion which, in recombining organisms, permits the reversal of the most common types of mutation. A model is proposed to explain the observation that introns, intergenic regions, and pseudogenes typically have lower GC content than the silent sites of corresponding open reading frames. This model is based on the observation that the greater the heterology between two sequences, the less likely it is that recombination will occur between them. According to this "Constraint" hypothesis, the formation and propagation of heteroduplex DNA is expected to occur, on average, more frequently within conserved coding and regulatory regions of the genome. In organisms possessing GC-biased mismatch repair, this would enhance the GC content of these regions through biased gene conversion. These findings have a number of important implications for the way we view genome evolution and suggest a new model for the evolution of sex.}

  Abstract                 = {Before the development of mass-vaccination campaigns. measles exhibited persistent fluctuations (endemic dynamics) in large British cities, and recurrent outbreaks (episodic dynamics) in smaller communities. The critical community size separating the two regimes was similar to300 000-500 000. We develop a model, the TSIR (Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks in measles. The model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration. It is thus a doubly stochastic model for disease dynamics. It further includes seasonality in the transmission rates. All parameters of the model are estimated on the basis of time series data on reported cases and reconstructed susceptible numbers from a set of cities in England and Wales in the prevaccination era (1944-1966). The 60 cities analyzed span a size range from London (3.3 X 10(6) inhabitants) to Teignmouth (10 500 inhabitants). The dynamics of all cities fit the model well. Transmission rates scale with community size, as expected from dynamics adhering closely to frequency dependent transmission ("true mass action"). These rates are further found to reveal strong seasonal variation, corresponding to high transmission during school terms and lower transmission during the school holidays. The basic reproductive ratio, R, is found to be invariant across the observed range of host community size, and the mean proportion of susceptible individuals also appears to be constant. Through the epidemic cycle, the susceptible population is kept within a 3\% interval. The disease is, thus. efficient in "regulating" the susceptible population-even in small cities that undergo recurrent epidemics with frequent extinction of the disease agent. Recolonization is highly sensitive to the random immigration process. The initial phase of the epidemic is also stochastic (due to demographic stochasticity and random immigration). However, the epidemic is nearly "deterministic" through most of the growth and decline phase. }

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the question of why the presentation of evolution in class frequently does not achieve acceptance of the evolutionary theory. In general, problems are twofold. Firstly, students may come to this particular topic with strong preconceptions, often based on specific religious teachings. Secondly, teachers may or may not bring an informed and/or dedicated approach to the teaching of evolution, relating to what they themselves were taught. Additional to our review of this topic and its problems, we suggest the use of a simple 'test' formulated, not on trying to impose knowledge and belief of evolution on the student, but on directing students towards the application of information on evolution to material already familiar to them. In this process, it is hoped that students will naturally incorporate at least some of the ideas of evolution into their own belief systems. Students are thus encouraged to assess or reassess evolution in terms of what they already consider to be true from their own experiences. Preliminary results (two trial runs) using this questionnaire indicate that students readily apply information with which they are familiar to Darwinian principles, and vice versa. These results, including verbal and written comments, also suggest that this 'test' may be meaningful as a first step towards acceptance of evolutionary theory. Teachers may find our questionnaire useful in determining a student's ability to understand evolutionary theory, and in exploring connections between understanding of and belief in evolution. },

Given that an ancient large-scale duplication will result in an excess of relatively old duplicated genes with similar ages, we analyzed the timing of duplication of pairs of paralogous genes in 14 model plant species. Using EST contigs (unigenes), we identified pairs of paralogous genes in each species and used the level of synonymous nucleotide substitution to estimate the relative ages of gene duplication. For nine of the investigated species (wheat [Triticum aestivum], maize [Zea mays], tetraploid cotton [Gossypium hirsutum], diploid cotton [G. arboretum], tomato [Lycopersicon esculentum], potato [Solanum tuberosum], soybean [Glycine max], barrel medic [Medicago truncatula], and Arabidopsis thaliana), the age distributions of duplicated genes contain peaks corresponding to short evolutionary periods during which large numbers of duplicated genes were accumulated. Large-scale duplications (polyploidy or aneuploidy) are strongly suspected to be the cause of these temporal peaks of gene duplication. However, the unusual age profile of tandem gene duplications in Arabidopsis indicates that other scenarios, such as variation in the rate at which duplicated genes are deleted, must also be considered. },

Genes retained in duplicate are not distributed evenly among Gene Ontology or Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences functional categories, which indicates a nonrandom process of gene loss. Genes involved in signal transduction and transcription have been preferentially retained, and those involved in DNA repair have been preferentially lost. Although the two members of each gene pair must originally have had identical transcription profiles, less than half of the pairs formed by the most recent polyploidy event still retain significantly correlated profiles. We identified several cases where groups of duplicated gene pairs have diverged in concert, forming two parallel networks, each containing one member of each gene pair. In these cases, the expression of each gene is strongly correlated with the other nonhomologous genes in its network but poorly correlated with its paralog in the other network. We also find that the rate of protein sequence evolution has been significantly asymmetric in >20\% of duplicate pairs. Together, these results suggest that functional diversification of the surviving duplicated genes is a major feature of the long-term evolution of polyploids. },

Furthermore, the abrogation of master epigenetic regulators, such as histone methyltransferases and DNA methyltransferases, correlates with loss of telomere-length control, and telomere shortening to a critical length affects the epigenetic status of telomeres and subtelomeres. These links between epigenetic status and telomere-length regulation provide important new avenues for understanding processes such as cancer development and ageing, which are characterized by telomere-length defects.},

Several genotypes, including cag(+), are associated with increased risk of gastric and duodenal diseases. With modern life, for probably the first time in human history, there are large numbers of noncolonized persons. Duodenal ulceration has been present essentially for only 200 years; that its incidence rose just as H. pylori was waning is best explained by changes in gastric microecology. As H. pylori is disappearing, duodenal ulceration and gastric cancer rates are falling. However, more proximal diseases, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), Barrett's esophagus, and adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia and lower esophagus, are increasing; colonization with cag(+) N. pylori strains appears protective against these diseases. Thus, in the 21st century, the continuing decline in H. pylori may lead to the disappearance of duodenal ulcers and distal gastric cancers and toward a marked increase in GERD, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma.},

As a first step toward addressing these questions, we created a hand-curated version of the Mendelian Inheritance in Man database (OMIM). We then examined selective pressures on Mendelian-disease genes, genes that contribute to complex-disease risk, and genes known to be essential in mouse by analyzing patterns of human polymorphism and of divergence between human and rhesus macaque. We found that Mendelian-disease genes appear to be under widespread purifying selection, especially when the disease mutations are dominant (rather than recessive). In contrast, the class of genes that influence complex-disease risk shows little signs of evolutionary conservation, possibly because this category includes targets of both purifying and positive selection.},

We draw attention to the form of this expansion found by Petrov for arbitrary order of the asymptotic parameter and present a simple algorithm realizing Petrov's prescription for the Edgeworth expansion.

Our theory also predicts that a protein can gain extra robustness to the first few substitutions by increasing its thermodynamic stability. We validate our theory with simulations on lattice protein models and by showing that it quantitatively predicts previously published experimental measurements on subtilisin and our own measurements on variants of TEM1 beta-lactamase.

From a single-trait perspective, we highlight that it is becoming clear that some trait types do not display significant levels of genetic variation, and we raise the possibility that species with restricted ranges may differ qualitatively from more widespread species in levels of genetic variance in ecologically important traits. A common misconception in many life-history studies is that a lack of genetic variance in single traits, and genetic constraints as a consequence of bivariate genetic correlations, are different causes of selection limits. We detail how interpretations of bivariate patterns are unlikely to demonstrate genetic limits to selection in many cases. We advocate a multivariate definition of genetic constraints that emphasizes the presence (or otherwise) of genetic variance in the multivariate direction of selection. For multitrait systems, recent results using longer term studies of organisms, in which more is understood concerning what traits may be under selection, have indicated that selection may exhaust genetic variance, resulting in a limit to the selection response. },

  Abstract                 = {Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice provides an example of an extraordinarily dynamic process with an extreme sensitivity of the phenotype of infection to parameters of virus/host interaction. A mathematical model is developed to examine the dynamics of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response for LCMV infection in mice. The model, formulated by a system of nonlinear delay-differential equations, considers the interacting populations of viruses, precursor CTLs, terminally differentiated effector CTLs and total virus antigen load. Clonal elimination of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells in high-dose LCMV-Docile infection represents an example of the classical phenomenon-high tone tolerance. To describe both conventional and exhaustive CTL responses in the acute phase of LCMV-D infection two mechanisms are invoked: the high virus antigen load inhibition of T-cell proliferation via anergy induction and the activation-induced cell death by apoptosis. Parameters of the model, characterizing the rates of virus and CTL production and elimination in spleen, are estimated by assimilating with the model data on the LCMV-D infection in C57BL/6 mice for low-, moderateand high-dose infections. It is suggested that not only the clonal expansions have to be described in mathematical models as being virus regulated but also the later phases of primary immune response. Down-regulation of the primary CTL response is controlled by a network of mechanisms inducing anergy and apoptosis in activated T cells. The model is used to investigate the effect of variations in virus and CTL response parameters on LCMV infection outcome and suggest predictions for experimental studies, in particular the phenotype of LCMV-WE infection in C57BL/6 as a function of initial virus doses.

This phenomenon, named CO interference, was originally defined genetically, but can also be analyzed cytologically by studying the chromosomal positions of protein complexes that are involved in CO formation, or by studying the positions of chiasmata. Here we focus on the cytological analysis of interference among protein complexes involved in meiotic recombination and CO formation in the mouse. During the pachytene stage of meiosis, these protein complexes can be visualized as immunofluorescent foci along synaptonemal complexes (SCs), which are linear protein structures that are formed along homologous chromosome pairs (bivalents) during meiotic prophase. We describe how to make cytological preparations that are suitable for the analysis of interference among these foci, and how to estimate the strength of interference among foci, using the gamma distribution as a mathematical model for focus/CO positioning.},

We report the development of a motility model, based on a three-dimensional lattice geometry, that meets these objectives. Cells make discrete jumps between neighbouring lattice sites in directions that are randomly determined from specified discrete probability distributions, which are defined by a small number of parameters. It is shown that the main characteristics of the random motion of T cells as typically observed in vivo can be reproduced by suitable specification of model parameters. The model is computationally highly efficient and provides a suitable engine for a model capable of simulating the full T-cell population of the paracortex. },

  Abstract                 = {Parasites reproduce and are subject to natural selection at several different, but intertwined, levels. In the recent paper, Gilchrist and Coombs (Theor. Popul. Biol. 69:145-153, 2006) relate the between-host transmission in the context of an SI model to the dynamics within a host. They demonstrate that within-host selection may lead to an outcome that differs from the outcome of selection at the host population level. In this paper we combine the two levels of reproduction by considering the possibility of superinfection and study the evolution of the pathogen's within-host reproduction rate p. We introduce a superinfection function phi= phi(p,q), giving the probability with which pathogens with trait q, upon transmission to a host that is already infected by pathogens with trait p, "take over" the host. We consider three cases according to whether the function q --> phi(p,q) (i) has a discontinuity, (ii) is continuous, but not differentiable, or (iii) is differentiable in q = p. We find that in case (i) the within-host selection dominates in the sense that the outcome of evolution at the host population level coincides with the outcome of evolution in a single infected host. In case (iii), it is the transmission to susceptible hosts that dominates the evolution to the extent that the singular strategies are the same as when the possibility of superinfections is ignored. In the biologically most relevant case (ii), both forms of reproduction contribute to the value of a singular trait. We show that when phi is derived from a branching process variant of the submodel for the within-host interaction of pathogens and target cells, the superinfection functions fall under case (ii). We furthermore demonstrate that the superinfection model allows for steady coexistence of pathogen traits at the host population level, both on the ecological, as well as on the evolutionary time scale. },

  Abstract                 = {Background: Superinfections are known to facilitate the co-existence of several pathogen strains in a host population. Previous models have demonstrated that pathogen virulence may undergo evolutionary branching, whereby an ancestral strain splits into two strains of different virulence. Evolutionary branching depends on the superinfection function as well as the trade-off between virulence and transmission, but reliable empirical data for these functions are scarce. Aim: To find necessary and sufficient conditions for evolutionary branching in an SI model (where S stands for susceptible and I for infected/infectious) with superinfections under any conceivable transmission-virulence trade-on. Methods: Adaptive dynamics and critical function analysis. Assumptions: The superinfection function is assumed to be differentiable, but otherwise arbitrary. We consider three different modes of host Population dynamics: constant population size, constant population birth rate, and logistic population growth in the absence of pathogens. Results: In the constant population birth rate model, evolutionary branching can always Occur if the convexity of the trade-off falls in a certain range; this range can however be narrow, especially if the singularity is at high virulence and relatively low transmission. With constant Population size and with logistic growth, mutual exclusion of strains occurs near some singularities, which excludes evolutionary branching in part of the parameter space. Comparison of methods: We show how critical function analysis relates to a more traditional analysis of the model via pairwise invasibility plots and bifurcation plots of evolutionary singularities.},

During the course of an infection, parasite variants may be generated that have some competitive advantage over the strains that initiated the infection. This intra-host competition may select for a short-term advantage. It can lead to variants without any transmission potential or variants with extremely high virulence. We develop a mathematical model which describes intraand inter-host parasite evolution. the major conclusions are: (i) intra-host competition generates a virulence polymorphism in the parasite population; (ii) intra-host competition can shift the mean virulence beyond what would maximize the reproductive rate of the parasite in the host population; and (iii) the parasite population can evolve to intermediate levels of virulence even if there is no trade-off between transmission rate and virulence. Our model applies to highly mutating parasites with long infection periods, such as, for example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). },

A study by Vail and Tebbets (1990) found slower developmental times for I. meal moth resistant to granulosis virus. Here data was taken from an experiment by Sait (1992) in which 3 host populations evolved in the presence of the virus and 3 evolved in the absence of it for a 2 year period. A probit analysis found evidence for the evolution of resistance in the exposed pop. Also found increased development time and weight for pupae of resistant pops. No change in number of eggs laid but a decrease in egg viabililty. Interestingly, increase in developmental time was found for the instars in which there was also an significant increase in resistance, while develop. times for instars in which resistance didn't evolve didn't change. Total fitness decrease in absence of virus of selected pop was approx 15PERCENT. They then calculate that resistance will be advantageous if the survivorship of the resistant, in the presence of the virus, is "1.052 times greater than that of the susceptible morph." Which I don't understand since one needs to really take into account the prevalence of the infection. My guess is that the 1.052 is when all hosts are exposed to the virus. Nonetheless, it would appear that resistance would generally be an advantage so long as the innoculum sizes weren't too big. Discussion: note that wide range of resistance is found in natural populations.

We show that there is a formal theoretical equivalence between the two criteria and discuss the characteristics of seperability that determine whether the criteria define the course of evolution. These theoretical determinants correspond biologically to whether strains compete for resources or not. We discuss the biological application of the criteria and argue that Do may be less widely applicable than R-0, but does determine the evolution of resistance in populations with fixed carrying capacities.

Assume no acquired resistance, no recovery and only uninfected host's reproduce in order to focus on "one possible route to disease resistance, avoidance of infection by reduced susceptibility to the disease." This is in contrast to our work which looks at the concept of post-infection processes and makes their model "most applicable to invertebrate and plant diseases\ldots" Assume a trade-off between susceptibility and intrinsic growth rate. Also assume density dependent growth. Once infected, all hosts behave the same. Variation in transmissibility is determined by susceptible genotype.

  Abstract                 = {Theory on the evolution of virulence generally predicts selection for an optimal level of virulence determined by trade-offs with transmission and/or recovery. Here we consider the evolution of pathogen virulence in hosts who acquire long-lived immunity and live in a spatially structured population. We show theoretically that large shifts in virulence may occur in pathogen populations as a result of a bistability in evolutionary dynamics caused by the local contact or social population structure of the host. This model provides an explanation for the rapid emergence of the highly virulent strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus. }

Brown, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, and approved January 26, 2007 (received for review September 28, 2006)Disease may play a critical role in invasions by nonnative plants and animals that currently threaten global biodiversity. For example, a generalist viral pathogen has been recently implicated in one of the most extensive plant invasions worldwide, the invasion and domination of California's perennial grasslands by exotic annual grasses. To date, disease has never been quantitatively assessed as a cause of this invasion. Using a model with field-estimated parameters, we demonstrate that pathogen presence was necessary to reverse competitive outcome and to allow exotic annual grass invasion and dominance. Although pathogen-induced reversal of a competitive hierarchy has been suggested as a mechanism of species invasion, here we quantitatively demonstrate the importance of this phenomenon by using field-derived parameters in a dynamical model. Pathogen-mediated reversals in competitive balance may be critically important for understanding past, and predicting future, invasions.},

AWRI1631 was found to be substantially different from S288c and YJM789, especially at the level of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which were present, on average, every 150 bp between all three strains. In addition, there were major differences in the arrangement and number of Ty elements between the strains, as well as several regions of DNA that were specific to AWRI1631 and that were predicted to encode proteins that are unique to this industrial strain. },

Complete specification of systems is impossible, so models must be simplified abstractions. Thus, the art of modeling involves deciding which system elements to include and determining how they should be represented. We view modeling as search through a space of candidate models that is guided by model objectives, theoretical knowledge, and empirical data. In this contribution, we introduce a method for representing process-based models that facilitates the discovery of structures that explain observed behavior. This representation casts dynamic systems as interacting sets of processes that act on entities. Using this approach, a modeler first encodes relevant ecological knowledge into a library of generic entities and processes, then instantiates these theoretical components, and finally assembles candidate models from these elements. We illustrate this methodology with a model of the Ross Sea ecosystem. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V. },

Some phylogenetic estimators use an explicit model of nucleotide evolution to estimate evolutionary parameters such as branch lengths and tree topology. There are many models to choose from, and use of the optimal model for a particular data set is important to avoid a loss of power and accuracy in phylogenetic estimations. Here, we review some molecular evolutionary forces and the parameters included in some common models of evolution used to interpret resulting patterns of molecular variation. We present some statistical methods of selecting a particular model of nucleotide evolution, and provide an empirical example of model selection. Statistical model selection strikes a balance between the bias introduced by some models and the increased variance of parameter estimates that results from using other models. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Researchers are increasingly recognizing that social effects influence the evolution of aging. Kin selection theory provides a framework for analyzing such effects because an individual's longevity and mortality schedule may alter its inclusive fitness via effects on the fitness of relatives. Kin-selected effects on aging have been demonstrated both by models of intergenerational transfers of investment by caregivers and by spatially explicit population models with limited dispersal. They also underlie coevolution between the degree and form of sociality and patterns of aging. In this review I critically examine and synthesize theory and data concerning these processes. I propose a classification, stemming from kin selection theory, of social effects on aging and describe a hypothesis for kin-selected conflict over parental time of death in systems with resource inheritance. I conclude that systematically applying kin selection theory to the analysis of the evolution of aging adds considerably to our general understanding of aging. },

We report here a reconstruction of human differentiation based on 100 DNA polymorphisms tested in five populations from four continents. The results agree with earlier conclusions based on other classes of genetic markers but reveal that Europeans do not fit a simple model of independently evolving populations with equal evolutionary rates. Evolutionary models involving early admixture are compatible with the data.Taking one such model into account, we examined through simulation whether random genetic drift alone might explain the variation among gene frequencies across populations and genes.A measure of variation among populations was calculated for each polymorphism, and its distribution for the 100 polymorphisms was compared with that expected for a drift-only hypothesis. At least two-thirds of the polymorphisms appear to be selectively neutral, but there are significant deviations at the two ends of the observed distribution of the measure of variation: a slight excess of polymorphisms with low variation and a greater excess with high variation. This indicates that a few DNA polymorphisms are affected by natural selection, rarely heterotic, and more often disruptive, while most are selectively neutral.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantifying the distribution of fitness effects among newly arising mutations in the human genome is key to resolving important debates in medical and evolutionary genetics. Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29\% of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (|s|<0.01\%), 30-42\% are moderately deleterious (0.01\%<|s|<1\%), and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal (|s|>1\%). Our results are consistent with 10-20\% of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.},

  Abstract                 = {The native structure of hemoglobin (Hb) comprises two alphaand two beta-subunits, each of which carries a heme group. There appear to be no previous studies that report the in vitro folding and assembly of Hb from highly unfolded alpha- and beta-globin in a "one-pot" reaction. One difficulty that has to be overcome for studies of this kind is the tendency of Hb to aggregate during refolding. This work demonstrates that denaturation of Hb in 40\% acetonitrile at pH 10.0 is reversible. A dialysis-mediated solvent change to a purely aqueous environment of pH 8.0 results in Hb refolding without any apparent aggregation. Fluorescence, Soret absorption, circular dichroism, and ESI mass spectra of the protein recorded before unfolding and after refolding are almost identical. By employing an externally pressurized dialysis cell that is coupled on-line to an ESI mass spectrometer, changes in heme binding behavior, protein conformation, and quaternary structure can be monitored as a function of time. The process occurs in a stepwise sequential manner, leading from monomeric alpha- and beta-globin to heterodimeric species, which then assemble into tetramers. Overall, this mechanism is consistent with previous studies employing the mixing of folded alpha- and beta-globin. However, some unexpected features are observed, e.g., a heme-deficient beta-globin dimer that represents an off-pathway intermediate. Monomeric beta-globin is capable of binding heme before forming a complex with an alpha-subunit. This observation suggests that holo-alpha-apo-beta globin does not represent an obligatory intermediate during Hb assembly, as had been proposed previously. The on-line dialysis/ESI-MS approach developed for this work represents a widely applicable tool for studying the folding and self-assembly of noncovalent biological complexes. },

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have highlighted the importance of a parasite protein referred to as the chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) in the molecular basis of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to the quinoline antimalarials. PfCRT, an integral membrane protein with 10 predicted transmembrane domains, is a member of the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily and is located on the membrane of the intra-erythrocytic parasite's digestive vacuole. Specific polymorphisms in PfCRT are tightly correlated with chloroquine resistance. Transfection studies have now proven that pfcrt mutations confer verapamil-reversible chloroquine resistance \emph{in vitro} and reveal their important role in resistance to quinine. Available evidence is consistent with the view that PfCRT functions as a transporter directly mediating the efflux of chloroquine from the digestive vacuole. },

They can also be reservoirs of pathogens that threaten domestic animal and human health. In this paper, we review the ecology of two viruses that have caused significant disease in domestic animals and humans and are carried by wild fruit bats in Asia and Australia. The first, Hendra virus, has caused disease in horses and/or humans in Australia every five years since it first emerged in 1994. Nipah virus has caused a major outbreak of disease in pigs and humans in Malaysia in the late 1990s and has also caused human mortalities in Bangladesh annually since 2001. Increased knowledge of fruit bat population dynamics and disease ecology will help improve our understanding of processes driving the emergence of diseases from bats. For this, a transdisciplinary approach is required to develop appropriate host management strategies that both maximise the conservation of bat populations as well as minimise the risk of disease outbreaks in domestic animals and humans.

Mention that one way to test whether or not a pathogen is at its max virulence (i.e. cant evolve to be more virulent even if selection was for greater levels) is through serial passages.Stairs 1973 = good survey of \emph{Baculovirus} virulence variation. Shapiro and Ignoffo 1970 for variation in of same genus on the cotton bollworm. Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965 for coevolution of both myxoma and rabbits. B\&P's findings: When nash equil. exists there can be coexistance of multiple parasites, if it doesn't exist then you get contiunual invasion by ever more virulent parasites. " For a broad range of infections diseases it can be assumed that the transmission trate and the disease induced mortality rate depend on the reproductive rate ($\lambda$) of the parasites, such that $\beta(\lambda)$ and $\alpha(\lambda)$ are monotonic increasing function of $\lambda$." Here reproduction apparently means the production of transmission propagules. "More generally, increases in host mortality with the size of parasitic infection are well documented from laboratory studies." no refs. B\&P functionally link $\alpha$ to $\lambda$ -- should cite for this. Assume that transmission is proportional to reproductive output of parasite, i.e. $\beta \propto \beta_e \lambda$. The implicitly ignore replication of parasite population within a host. Assume that $\alpha(\lambda)$ is convex upward, i.e. accelerating and use a quadratic function (but also mention more complex case where its an infinite polynomial which should describe any function). Come up with an optimal birth rate which will be infinite if the term if the relationship is linear. Also mention that in general if $\nu$ is 0 then it will select for less virulent parasites. (i.e. recovery becomes independent of $\alpha$, imagining, I assume, a step function of some sort) Competing strains within a host: Assuming interactions between parasite effects (i.e. parasite damage is not additive across strains) then $\alpha = (\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \lambda_i)^2$ then there is no nash equilibrium and selection favors ever increasing parsite reproductive rates. This makes since since due to the non-additivities of strain added mortality. Looking at additive case and others they find that if the exponent is greater than 2, presumably, then you can have a nash equilibrium iff the exponent term is greater than the number of competeting strains.}

Sequences of the free ends of the cloned templates on each microbead were then simultaneously analyzed using a fluorescence-based signature sequencing method that does not require DNA fragment separation. Signature sequences of 19-20 bases were obtained by repeated cycles of enzymatic cleavage with a type Ils restriction endonuclease, adaptor ligation, and sequence interrogation by encoded hybridization probes. The approach was validated by sequencing over 269,000 signatures from two cDNA libraries constructed from a fully sequenced strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and by measuring gene expression levels in the human cell line THP-1. The approach provides an unprecedented depth of analysis permitting application of powerful statistical techniques for discovery of functional relationships among genes, whether known or unknown beforehand, or whether expressed at high or very low levels.},

We also identified within this domain a missense mutation that produced MED Fairbank. In two families, one with mild PSACH and the second with a form of MED, we identified different substitutions for a residue in the carboxyl-terminal globular region of COMP. Both the clinical presentations of these two families and the identification of COMP-gene mutations provide evidence of phenotypic overlap between PSACH and MED.

Comparing Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes, we found that the greater length of eukaryotic proteins is pervasive over all functional categories and involves the vast majority of protein families. The magnitude of these differences suggests that the evolution of eukaryotic proteins was influenced by processes of fusion of single-function proteins into extended multifunctional and multi-domain proteins. Comparing Bacteria and Archaea, we determined that the small but significant length difference observed between their proteins results from a combination of three factors: (i) bacterial proteomes include a greater proportion than archaeal proteomes of longer proteins involved in metabolism or cellular processes, (ii) within most functional classes, protein families unique to Bacteria are generally longer than protein families unique to Archaea and (iii) within the same protein family, homologs from Bacteria tend to be longer than the corresponding homologs from Archaea. These differences are interpreted with respect to evolutionary trends and prevailing environmental conditions within the two prokaryotic groups. }

We analyzed a population of baker's yeast that underwent 450 generations of glucose-limited growth. Relative to the strain used as the inoculum, the predominant cell type at the end of this experiment sustains growth at significantly lower steady-state glucose concentrations and demonstrates markedly enhanced cell yield per mole glucose, significantly enhanced high-affinity glucose transport, and greater relative fitness in pairwise competition. These changes are correlated with increased levels of {mRNA} hybridizing to probe generated from the hexose transport locus HXT6. Further analysis of the evolved strain reveals the existence of multiple tandem duplications involving two highly similar, high-affinity hexose transport loci, HXT6 and HXT7. Selection appears to have favored changes that result in the formation of more than three chimeric genes derived from the upstream promoter of the HXT7 gene and the coding sequence of HXT6. We propose a genetic mechanism to account for these changes and speculate as to their adaptive significance in the context of gene duplication as a common response of microorganisms to nutrient limitation. },

  Abstract                 = {A recent empirical study by Turner and Chao on the evolution of competitive interactions among phage virus strains revealed that a strain grown at high rates of co-infection evolved towards lowered fitness relative to an ancestral strain. The authors went on to show that the fitness pay-off matrix between the evolved and ancestral strain conforms to the prisoners' dilemma. In this paper, I use Turner and Chao's data to parameterize a simple model of parasite collective action. The prisoners' dilemma is based on pairwise interactions of a discrete cooperate/defect nature. In contrast, the collective action model explicitly deals with individual-group interactions where the extent of cooperation is a continuous variable. I argue here that the 'collective action' modelling approach is more appropriate than the prisoners' dilemma for the biology of virus evolution, and hence better able to form a predictive framework for further work on related strains of virus, linking mixing ecology, cooperative phenotype and fitness. Furthermore, the collective action model is used to motivate discussion on the evolutionary ecology of viruses, with a focus on the 'levels of selection' debate and the evolution of virulence.},

  Abstract                 = {Concomitant immunity (CI) against macroparasites describes a state of effective anti-larval immunity coupled with persistent adult infection. Experimental studies indicate that immunologically concealed adult worms might promote anti-larval immunity via the release of cross-reactive antigens, thus creating a barrier against continual infection and restricting burden size within the host. CI offers an important potential benefit to established worms by preventing overcrowding within the host. Thus, CI may be interpreted as akin to vaccination; relatively long-lived adult worms 'vaccinate' their host with larval surface antigens and so benefit from reduced conspecific competition. The shared responsibility for host vaccination among adult worms leads to a problem of collective action. Here, we build on earlier analytical findings about the evolutionary forces that shape cooperation among parasites in order to produce a stochastic simulation model of macroparasite social evolution. First, we theoretically investigate a parasite adaptation hypothesis of CI and demonstrate its plausibility under defined conditions, despite the possibility of evolutionary 'cheats'. Then we derive a set of predictions for testing the hypothesis that CI is partly a host-manipulative parasite adaptation. Evidence in support of this model would present an unusual case of adaptive population regulation.},

By monitoring a constitutively produced signal molecule, individual bacteria call limit their expression of group-beneficial phenotypes to cell densities that guarantee an effective group outcome. In this paper, we attempt to move away from a commonly expressed view that these impressive feats of coordination are examples of multicellularity in prokaryotic populations. Here, re we look more closely at the individual conflict underlying this cooperation, illustrating that, even under significant levels of genetic conflict, signalling and resultant cooperative behaviour can stably exist. A predictive two-trait model of signal strength and of the extent of cooperation is developed as a function of relatedness (reflecting multiplicity of infection) and basic population demographic parameters. The model predicts that the strength of quorum signalling will increase as conflict (multiplicity of infecting strains) increases, as individuals attempt to coax more cooperative contributions from their competitors, leading to a devaluation of the signal as an indicator of density. Conversely, as genetic conflict increases, the model predicts that the threshold density for cooperation will increase and the subsequent strength of group cooperation will be depressed.},

In particular, population dynamics of social traits could be exploited to introduce less virulent strains of bacteria, or medically beneficial alleles into infective populations. We discuss how bacterial strains adopting different social strategies can invade a population of cooperative wild-type, considering public good cheats, cheats carrying medically beneficial alleles (Trojan horses) and cheats carrying allelopathic traits (anti-competitor chemical bacteriocins or temperate bacteriophage viruses). We suggest that exploitation of the ability of cheats to invade cooperative, wild-type populations is a potential new strategy for treating bacterial disease.},

Recent results have revealed the historical recombination rates and the distribution of hotspots across the human genome. Surprisingly, CO hotspots are highly dynamic, as shown by differences in activity between individuals, populations and closely related species. We propose a role for DNA methylation in preventing the formation of COs, a regulation that might explain, in part, the correlation between recombination rates and GC content in mammals. },

The first speaker, Timothy Caulfield, introduced the intersecting communities that promulgate a 'cycle of hype' of the timelines and expected outcomes of the Human Genome Project (HGP): scientists, the media and the public. Other actors also contribute to the overall hype, the social science and humanities communities, industry and politicians. There currently appears to be an abatement of the overblown rhetoric of the HGP. As pointed out by the second speaker, Sharon Kardia, there is broad recognition that most phenotypic traits, including disease susceptibility are multi-factorial. That said, George Davey-Smith reminded us that some direct genotype-phenotype associations may be useful for public health issues. The Mendelian randomization approach hopes to revitalize the discipline of epidemiology by strengthening causal influences about environmentally modifiable risk factors. A more realistic informational environment paves the way for greater public engagement in science policy. Two such initiatives were presented by Kardia and Jason Robert, and Peter Finegold emphasized that science education and professional development for science teachers are important components of later public engagement in science issues. However, pressures on public research institutions to commercialize and seek industry funding may have negative impacts in both encouraging scientists to inappropriately hype research and on diminishing public trust in the scientific enterprise. The latter may have a significant effect on public engagement processes, such as those proposed by Robert and Kardia.},

Here, we sought evidence of A- and P-site {tRNA} interaction by examining bias in codon pair choice within open reading frames from a range of genomes. Three distinct and marked effects were revealed once codon and dipeptide biases had been subtracted. First, in the majority of genomes, codon pair preference is primarily determined by a tetranucleotide combination of the third nucleotide of the P-site codon, and all 3 nt of the A-site codon. Second, pairs of rare codons are generally under-used in eukaryotes, but over-used in prokaryotes. Third, the analysis revealed a highly significant effect of {tRNA}-mediated selection on codon pairing in unicellular eukaryotes, Bacillus subtilis, and the gamma proteobacteria. This was evident because in these organisms, synonymous codons decoded in the A-site by the same {tRNA} exhibit significantly similar P-site pairing preferences. Codon pair preference is thus influenced by the identity of A-site {tRNA}s, in combination with the P-site codon third nucleotide. Multivariate analysis identified conserved nucleotide positions within A-site {tRNA} sequences that modulate codon pair preferences. Structural features that regulate {tRNA} geometry within the ribosome may govern genomic codon pair patterns, driving enhanced translational fidelity and/or rate.},

Based on recent knowledge of fish immunity and skin response mechanisms in mammals a model for the skin immunity in fish to monogenean infections is proposed. Important cellular components of the model are the epithelial cells, the mucous cells and leucocytes. The release of cytokines, e.g. IL-1, following mechanical or chemical injury of the epithelial cells, initiates a series of events leading to decrease of the ectoparasite population. Cytokines (e.g. IL-1, TNF, INF) are suggested to affect secretions from mucous cell and attract neutrophils and macrophages. Leukotrienes are probably involved in the inflammatory reactions. The subsequent production of humoral substances (among others complement factors and peptides) could be responsible for the antiparasitic response in the later stages of infection. Although non-specific factors dominate the response, the involvement of specific antibodies and lymphocytes cannot be excluded.}

An assumption of this method is that codon changes have individually small effects, such that codon-attenuated viruses will be slow to evolve back to high fitness (and thus to high virulence). The major capsid gene of the bacterial virus T7 was modified to have varying levels of suboptimal synonymous codons in different constructs, and fitnesses declined linearly with the number of changes. Adaptation of the most extreme design, with 182 codon changes, resulted in a slow fitness recovery by standards of previous experimental evolution with this virus, although fitness effects of substitutions were higher than expected from the average effect of an engineered codon modification. Molecular evolution during recovery was modest, and changes evolved both within the modified gene and outside it. Some changes within the modified gene evolved in parallel across replicates, but with no obvious explanation. Overall, the study supports the premise that codon-modified viruses recover fitness slowly, although the evolution is substantially more rapid than expected from the design principle.},

In contrast, the pharmacodynamics of novel alternative therapeutic agents, such as phages and bacteriocins against bacterial infections or viruses engineered to target tumour cells, is governed by a 'single-hit' kinetics according to which the agent will kill once it is bound to its target. In addition to requiring only a single molecule for killing, these agents bind irreversibly to their targets. Here, we explore the pharmacodynamics of such 'irreversible, single-hit inhibitors' using mathematical models. We focus on agents that do not replicate, i.e. in the case of phage therapy, we deal only with non-lytic phages and in the case of cancer treatment, we restrict our analysis to replication of incompetent viruses.

Using data from the current study, published sequences, database searches, and molecular techniques, we identified 23 recombinant NoV GII and 1 recombinant NoV GI isolates. Analysis of the genetic relationships among the recombinant NoV GII isolates identified 9 independent recombinant sequences; the other 14 strains were close relatives. Two of the 9 independent recombinant NoV were closely related to other recombinants only in the polymerase region, and in a similar fashion 1 recombinant NoV was closely related to another only in the capsid region. Breakpoint analysis of recombinant NoV showed that recombination occurred in the open reading frame (ORF)1/ORF2 overlap. We provide evidence to support the theory of the role of subgenomic RNA promoters as recombination hotspots and describe a simple mechanism of how recombination might occur in NoV.}

  Abstract                 = {It is argued that the bias in synonymous codon usage observed in unicellular organisms is due to a balance between the forces of selection and mutation in a finite population, with greater bias in highly expressed genes reflecting stronger selection for efficiency of translation. A population genetic model is developed taking into account population size and selective differences between synonymous codons. A biochemical model is then developed to predict the magnitude of selective differences between synonymous codons in unicellular organisms in which growth rate (or possibly growth yield) can be equated with fitness. Selection can arise from differences in either the speed or the accuracy of translation. A model for the effect of speed of translation on fitnes is considered in detail, a similar model for accuracy more briefly. The model is successful in predicting a difference in the degree of bias at the beginning than in the rest of the gene under some circumstances, as observed in \emph{Escherichia coli}, but grossly overestimates the amount of bias expected. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. },

Despite the critical importance of centromere function, centromeric sequences are not conserved. This has prompted exploration of other genomic and chromatin features to gain an understanding of where CENP-A is deposited. In this review we highlight recent papers that advance our understanding of how the cell builds a centromere. We focus on what influences the choice of site for CENP-A deposition and therefore the site of centromere formation. We then briefly discuss how centromeres are propagated once the site of centromere assembly is chosen. },

  Abstract                 = {Comparisons of DNA polymorphism within species to divergence between species enables the discovery of molecular adaptation in evolutionarily constrained genes as well as the differentiation of weak from strong purifying selection(1-4). The extent to which weak negative and positive darwinian selection have driven the molecular evolution of different species varies greatly(5-16), with some species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, showing strong evidence of pervasive positive selection(6-9), and others, such as the selfing weed Arabidopsis thaliana, showing an excess of deleterious variation within local populations(9,10). Here we contrast patterns of coding sequence polymorphism identified by direct sequencing of 39 humans for over 11,000 genes to divergence between humans and chimpanzees, and find strong evidence that natural selection has shaped the recent molecular evolution of our species. Our analysis discovered 304 (9.0\%) out of 3,377 potentially informative loci showing evidence of rapid amino acid evolution. Furthermore, 813 (13.5\%) out of 6,033 potentially informative loci show a paucity of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees, indicating weak negative selection and/or balancing selection operating on mutations at these loci. We find that the distribution of negatively and positively selected genes varies greatly among biological processes and molecular functions, and that some classes, such as transcription factors, show an excess of rapidly evolving genes, whereas others, such as cytoskeletal proteins, show an excess of genes with extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans and yet little amino acid divergence between humans and chimpanzees.},

The excellent numerical accuracy is demonstrated in the calculation of noncentral moments of Wilks' A and the likelihood ratio statistic for testing block independence, and in the calculation of the CDF of the noncentral distribution of Wilks' A via a sequential saddlepoint approximation. Relative error properties of these approximations are also studied, and it is noted that the approximations have uniformly bounded relative errors in important cases. },

To do so, we measured the strength of selection, estimated genetic variation and covariation, and predicted the response to selection for women in the Framingham Heart Study, a project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Boston University that began in 1948. We found that natural selection is acting to cause slow, gradual evolutionary change. The descendants of these women are predicted to be on average slightly shorter and stouter, to have lower total cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure, to have their first child earlier, and to reach menopause later than they would in the absence of evolution. Selection is tending to lengthen the reproductive period at both ends. To better understand and predict such changes, the design of planned large, long-term, multicohort studies should include input from evolutionary biologists.},

  Abstract                 = {By definition, the terms sepsis and septic shock refer to a potentially fatal infectious state in which the early administration of an effective antibiotic is the most significant determinant of the outcome. Because of the global spread of resistant bacteria, the efficacy of antibiotics has been severely compromised. S. pneumonia, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas are the predominant pathogens of sepsis and septic shock. It is common for E. coli, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas to be resistant to multiple drugs. Multiple drug resistance is caused by the interplay of multiple resistance mechanisms those emerge via the acquisition of extraneous resistance determinants or spontaneous mutations. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) and quinolone resistance determinants are typically external and disseminate on mobile genetic elements, while porin-efflux mechanisms are activated by spontaneous modifications of inherited structures. Porin and efflux mechanisms are frequent companions of multiple drug resistance in Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa, but only occasionally detected among E. coli and Klebsiella. Antibiotic resistance became a global health threat. This review examines the major resistance mechanisms of the leading microorganisms of sepsis.},

First, I provide an alternative interpretation of what underwrites this revolution, motivated by some recent work on model-based science.

Transcriptional repression was shown to be the major control mechanism of the biosynthetic genes, leaving only limited room for additional transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. The art genes, encoding the specific arginine uptake system, are subject to ArgR-mediated repression, with strong repression of artJ, encoding the periplasmic binding protein of the system. The hisJQMP genes of the histidine transporter (part of the lysine-arginine-ornithine uptake system) were discovered to be a part of the arginine regulon. Analysis of their control region with reporter gene fusions and electrophoretic mobility shift in the presence of pure ArgR repressor showed the involvement in repression of the ArgR protein and an ARG box 120 bp upstream of hisJ. No repression of the genes of the third uptake system, arginine-ornithine, was observed. Finally, comparison of the time course of arginine repression of gene transcription with the evolution of the specific activities of the cognate enzymes showed that while full genetic repression was achieved 2 min after arginine addition, enzyme concentrations were diluted at the rate of cell division. This emphasizes the importance of feedback inhibition of the first enzymic step in the pathway in controlling the metabolic flow through biosynthesis in the period following the onset of repression.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolutionary potential of a gene is constrained not only by the amino acid sequence of its product, but by its DNA sequence as well. The topology of the genetic code is such that half of the amino acids exhibit synonymous codons that can reach different subsets of amino acids from each other through single mutation. Thus, synonymous DNA sequences should access different regions of the protein sequence space through a limited number of mutations, and this may deeply influence the evolution of natural proteins. Here, we demonstrate that this feature can be of value for manipulating protein evolvability. We designed an algorithm that, starting from an input gene, constructs a synonymous sequence that systematically includes the codons with the most different evolutionary perspectives; i.e., codons that maximize accessibility to amino acids previously unreachable from the template by point mutation. A synonymous version of a bacterial antibiotic resistance gene was computed and synthesized. When concurrently submitted to identical directed evolution protocols, both the wild type and the recoded sequence led to the isolation of specific, advantageous phenotypic variants. Simulations based on a mutation isolated only from the synthetic gene libraries were conducted to assess the impact of sub-functional selective constraints, such as codon usage, on natural adaptation. Our data demonstrate that rational design of synonymous synthetic genes stands as an affordable improvement to any directed evolution protocol. We show that using two synonymous DNA sequences improves the overall yield of the procedure by increasing the diversity of mutants generated. These results provide conclusive evidence that synonymous coding sequences do experience different areas of the corresponding protein adaptive landscape, and that a sequence's codon usage effectively constrains the evolution of the encoded protein.},

Assigned readings alternated between text assignments and articles from the primary literature. Students were made accountable for their own preparation by the administration of a quiz at the start of each class. Group discussion of the topics engaged students in the learning process and readministration of the quiz at the end of class allowed them to benefit from the group interaction and understanding. Interspersing text readings and primary literature led to student understanding of how genetic knowledge is acquired and interpreted and how experimental detail leads to the construction of general models. },

  Abstract                 = {Evolution requires the generation and optimization of new traits ("adaptation") and involves the selection of mutations that improve cellular function. These mutations were assumed to arise by selection of neutral mutations present at all times in the population. Here we review recent evidence that indicates that deleterious mutations are more frequent in the population than previously recognized and that these mutations play a significant role in protein evolution through continuous positive selection. Positively selected mutations include adaptive mutations, i.e. mutations that directly affect enzymatic function, and compensatory mutations, which suppress the pleiotropic effects of adaptive mutations. Compensatory mutations are by far the most frequent of the two and would allow potentially adaptive but deleterious mutations to persist long enough in the population to be positively selected during episodes of adaptation. Compensatory mutations are, by definition, context-dependent and thus constrain the paths available for evolution. This provides a mechanistic basis for the examples of highly constrained evolutionary landscapes and parallel evolution reported in natural and experimental populations. The present review article describes these recent advances in the field of protein evolution and discusses their implications for understanding the genetic basis of disease and for protein engineering \emph{in vitro}.}

  Abstract                 = {The size and diversity of bacteriophage populations require methodologies to quantitatively study the landscape of phage differences. Statistical approaches are confronted with small genome sizes forbidding significant single-phage analysis, and comparative methods analyzing full phage genomes represent an alternative but they are of difficult interpretation due to lateral gene transfer, which creates a mosaic spectrum of related phage species. Based on a large-scale codon bias analysis of 116 DNA phages hosted by 11 translationally biased bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic families, we observe that phage genomes are almost always under codon selective pressure imposed by translationally biased hosts, and we propose a classification of phages with translationally biased hosts which is based on adaptation patterns. We introduce a computational method for comparing phages sharing homologous proteins, possibly accepted by different hosts. We observe that throughout phages, independently from the host, capsid genes appear to be the most affected by host translational bias. For coliphages, genes involved in virion morphogenesis, host interaction and ssDNA binding are also affected by adaptive pressure. Adaptation affects long and small phages in a significant way. We analyze in more detail the Microviridae phage space to illustrate the potentiality of the approach. The small number of directions in adaptation observed in phages grouped around phi X174 is discussed in the light of functional bias. The adaptation analysis of the set of Microviridae phages defined around phi MH2K shows that phage classification based on adaptation does not reflect bacterial phylogeny. },

  Abstract                 = {We propose a simple algorithm to detect dominating synonymous codon usage bias in genomes. The algorithm is based on a precise mathematical formulation of the problem that lead us to use the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) as a 'universal' measure of codon bias. This measure has been previously employed in the specific context of translational bias. With the set of coding sequences as a sole source of biological information, the algorithm provides a reference set of genes which is highly representative of the bias. This set can be used to compute the CAI of genes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including those whose functional annotation is not yet available. An important application concerns the detection of a reference set characterizing translational bias which is known to correlate to expression levels; in this case, the algorithm becomes a key tool to predict gene expression levels, to guide regulatory circuit reconstruction, and to compare species. The algorithm detects also leading-lagging strands bias, GC-content bias, GC3 bias, and horizontal gene transfer. The approach is validated on 12 slow-growing and fast-growing bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. },

As the amino acid sequences of the ADH protein were identical in the four genotypes assayed, differences in ethanol tolerance were due to differences in the abundance of ADH protein, presumably driven by the effects of codon bias on translational efficiency. The ethanol tolerance of genotypes decreased with the number of unpreferred synonymous mutations, and a positive correlation between ADH protein abundance and ethanol tolerance was observed.

The codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis predicts that the wobble nucleotide of {tRNA} anticodon should evolve toward maximizing the Watson-Crick base pairing with the most frequently used codon within each synonymous codon family. In contrast, the wobble versatility hypothesis argues that the nucleotide at the wobble site should be occupied by a nucleotide most versatile in wobble pairing, i.e., the wobble site of the {tRNA} anticodon should be G for NNY codon families and U for NNR and NNN codon families (where Y stands for C or U, R for A or G, and N for any nucleotide). We examined codon usage and anticodon wobble sites in 36 fungal genomes to evaluate these two alternative hypotheses and identify exceptional cases that deserve new explanations. While the wobble versatility hypothesis is generally supported, there are interesting exceptions involving {tRNA}(Arg) translating the CGN codon family, {tRNA}(Trp) translating the UGR codon family, and {tRNA}(Met) translating the AUR codon family. Our results suggest that the potential to suppress stop codons, the historical inertia, and the conflict between translation initiation and elongation can all contribute to determining the wobble nucleotide of {tRNA} anticodons. },

Questions addressed by these models mainly concentrate on TB control strategies, optimal vaccination policies, approaches toward the elimination of TB in the U.S.A., TB co-infection with HIV/AIDS, drug-resistant TB, responses of the immune system, impacts of demography, the role of public transportation systems, and the impact of contact patterns. Model formulations involve a variety of mathematical areas, such as ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) (both autonomous and non-autonomous systems), PDEs (Partial Differential Equations), system of difference equations, system of integro-differential equations, Markov chain model, and simulation models. },

We discuss the levels of accuracy needed to match predicted proteins to observed proteins based solely on M, and pi criteria obtained from genomic information, and propose methodology to achieve this level of accuracy. In addition, we will address the future goals of this work since the small genomes of bacteria provide a foundation and stepping stone to similar studies in higher organisms. }

The frequency of productive mononuclear cells (MNCs) initially diminished with a half-life of about 1 day. Surprisingly, the amount of HIV-1 RNA in virus trapped on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) decreased almost as quickly. After 24 weeks, MNCs with very few copies of HIV-1 RNA per cell were still detectable, as was proviral DNA; however, the amount of FDC-associated virus decreased by greater than or equal to 3.4 log units. Thus, 6 months of potent therapy controlled active replication and cleared >99.9 percent of virus from the secondary lymphoid tissue reservoir.},

Only 22\% of these TFBS regions are located at the 5' termini of protein-coding genes while 36\% lie within or immediately 3' to well-characterized genes and are significantly correlated with noncoding RNAs. A significant number of these noncoding RNAs are regulated in response to retinoic acid, and overlapping pairs of protein-coding and noncoding RNAs are often coregulated. Thus, the human genome contains roughly comparable numbers of protein-coding and noncoding genes that are bound by common transcription factors and regulated by common environmental signals.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimating the correlation coefficient between two outcome variables is one of the most important aspects of epidemiological and clinical research. A simple Pearson's correlation coefficient method is usually employed when there are complete independent data points for both outcome variables. However, researchers often deal with correlated observations in a longitudinal setting with missing values where a simple Pearson's correlation coefficient method cannot be used. General linear mixed models (GLMM) techniques were used to estimate correlation coefficients in a longitudinal data set with missing values. A random regression mixed model with unstructured covariance matrix was employed to estimate correlation coefficients between concentrations of HIV-1 RNA in blood and seminal plasma. The effects of CD4 count and antiretroviral therapy were also examined. We used data sets from three different centres (650 samples from 238 patients) where blood and seminal plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations were collected from patients; 137 samples from 90 different patients without antiviral therapy and 513 samples from 148 patients receiving therapy were considered for analysis. We found no significant correlation between blood and semen HIV-1 RNA concentration in the absence of antiviral therapy. However, a moderate correlation between blood and semen HIV-1 RNA was observed among subjects with lower CD4 counts receiving therapy. Our findings confirm and extend the idea that the concentrations of HIV-1 in semen often differ from the HIV-1 concentration in blood. Antiretroviral therapy administered to subjects with low CD4 counts result in sufficient concomitant reduction of HIV-1 in blood and semen so as to improve the correlation between these compartments. These results have important implications for studies related to the sexual transmission of HIV, and development of HIV prevention strategies. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd. }

  Abstract                 = {Objective: To develop a model to predict transmission of HIV-1 from men to women. Design: HIV-1 in seminal plasma, and endocervical CCR5 receptors were correlated with epidemiological studies of HIV-1 transmission to develop a probabilistic model. Settings: Semen samples were collected from patient subjects in Seattle Washington, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and St. Gallen, Switzerland. Endocervical biopsy specimens were obtained from women in Chicago, Illinois. Participants: Eighty-six men (not receiving antireroviral therapy) in whom CD4 cell count and semen volume were available, and 24 women in whom the number of endocervical CCR5 receptors were determined. Main outcome measures: Prediction of transmission of HIV-1 from men to women per episode of vaginal intercourse based on the absolute burden of HIV (volume x HIV RNA copies/ml seminal plasma). Results: The model suggests efficient heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 when semen viral burden is high. When semen contains 1 00 000 copies of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) HIV RNA the probability of HIV-1 transmission is 1 per 100 episodes of intercourse; conversely, with 1000 copies NSI HIV RNA in semen, transmission probability is 3 per 10 000 episodes of intercourse. Conclusions: This model links biological and epidemiological data related to heterosexual HIV-1 transmission. The model can be used to estimate transmission of HIV from men with high semen viral burden from inflammation, or reduced burden after antiretroviral therapy. The results offer a biological explanation for the magnitude of the HIV epidemic in places where earlier studies have shown men have high semen viral burden, such as in sub-Saharan Africa. The model can be used to develop and test HIV-1 prevention strategies. (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins. }

  Abstract                 = {Background: Evolutionary rates of proteins in a protein-protein interaction network are primarily governed by the protein connectivity and/or expression level. A recent study revealed the importance of the features of the interacting protein partners, viz., the coefficient of functionality and clustering coefficient in controlling the protein evolutionary rates in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results: By multivariate regression analysis we found that the three parameters: probability of complex formation, expression level and degree of a protein independently guide the evolutionary rates of proteins in the PPI network. The contribution of the complex forming property of a protein and its expression level led to nearly 43\% of the total variation as observed from the first principal component. We also found that for complex forming proteins in the network, those which have partners sharing the same functional class evolve faster than those having partners belonging to different functional classes. The proteins in the dense parts of the network evolve faster than their counterparts which are present in the sparse regions of the network. Taking into account the complex forming ability, we found that all the complex forming proteins considered in this study evolve slower than the noncomplex forming proteins irrespective of their localization in the network or the affiliation of their partners to same/different functional classes. Conclusions: We have shown here that the functionality and clustering coefficient correlated with the degree of the protein in the protein-protein interaction network. We have identified the significant relationship of the complex-forming property of proteins and their evolutionary rates even when they are classified according to the features of their interacting partners. Our study implies that the evolutionarily constrained proteins are actually members of a larger number of protein complexes and this justifies why they have enhanced expression levels. },

  Abstract                 = {Background: In mammals, contrary to what is usually assumed, recent evidence suggests that synonymous mutations may not be selectively neutral. This position has proven contentious, not least because of the absence of a viable mechanism. Here we test whether synonymous mutations might be under selection owing to their effects on the thermodynamic stability of {mRNA}, mediated by changes in secondary structure. Results: We provide numerous lines of evidence that are all consistent with the above hypothesis. Most notably, by simulating evolution and reallocating the substitutions observed in the mouse lineage, we show that the location of synonymous mutations is non-random with respect to stability. Importantly, the preference for cytosine at 4-fold degenerate sites, diagnostic of selection, can be explained by its effect on {mRNA} stability. Likewise, by interchanging synonymous codons, we find naturally occurring {mRNA}s to be more stable than simulant transcripts. Housekeeping genes, whose proteins are under strong purifying selection, are also under the greatest pressure to maintain stability. Conclusion: Taken together, our results provide evidence that, in mammals, synonymous sites do not evolve neutrally, at least in part owing to selection on {mRNA} stability. This has implications for the application of synonymous divergence in estimating the mutation rate.},

We recently demonstrated that this translational control involves a stress-specific reprogramming of modified ribonucleosides in tRNA. Here we report the discovery of a step-wise translational control mechanism responsible for survival following oxidative stress. In yeast exposed to hydrogen peroxide, there is a Trm4 methyltransferase-dependent increase in the proportion of tRNA(Leu((C) under bar AA)) containing m(5)C at the wobble position, which causes selective translation of mRNA from genes enriched in the TTG codon. Of these genes, oxidative stress increases protein expression from the TTG-enriched ribosomal protein gene RPL22A, but not its unenriched paralogue. Loss of either TRM4 or RPL22A confers hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Proteomic analysis reveals that oxidative stress causes a significant translational bias towards proteins coded by TTG-enriched genes. These results point to stress-induced reprogramming of tRNA modifications and consequential reprogramming of ribosomes in translational control of cell survival.},

Models where age-specific mutations have pleiotropic effects on mortality that extend either throughout adult life, or are confined to juvenile stages, produce equilibria with exponential increases in the mean and additive variance of mortality rates during much of adult life. However, the rates of increase diminish late in life, and can even become zero. Predictions concerning the additive genetic correlations in mortality rates between different ages are also developed.

The data are stored in a relational database, accessible by a number of user-friendly search methods and graphical browsers. The database schema is generic and can easily be applied to other bacterial genomes.

  Abstract                 = {The possible codon-anticodon pairings follow the standard genetic code, yet in a different mode. The corresponding rules for decoding sequence of the codons in mRNA with tRNA may be called "tRNA code". In this paper we analyse the mutational and translational stability of such tRNA code. Our approach is based on the model of "ambiguous intermediate" and on the study of underlying block structure and Eulerean graph technique. It is shown that the wobble rules and the reduced number of tRNA anticodons strongly affect the mutational and translational stability of the code. The selection of tRNA anticodons, besides the optimization of translation, also ensures the more reliable start and, to a lesser extent, the stop of translation. The attribution of tRNA anticodons to the groups {WWW, WWS, SWW, SWS} and {SSS, SSW, WSS, WSW} as well as {MMM, MMK, KMM, KMK} and {KKK, KKM, MKK, MKM} clearly correlates with class 1 and class 11 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and obeys the principle of the optimal coding in both cases. Both W-S and M-K groupings also refer to the encoding of amino acids with the large and small side-chain volumes, which may provide such an attribution. The higher variability of tRNA code agrees with the suggestions that the variations in an assignment of tRNA anticodons may serve as the driving force generating the different variants of the genetic code.

  Abstract                 = {Background: Most bacterial chromosomes exhibit asymmetry of base composition with respect to leading vs. lagging strands ( GC and AT skews). These skews reflect mainly those in protein coding sequences, which are driven by asymmetric mutation pressures during replication and transcription ( notably asymmetric cytosine deamination) plus subsequent selection for preferred structures, signals, amino acid or codons. The transcription-associated effects but not the replication-associated effects contribute to the overall skews through the uneven distribution of the coding sequences on the leading and lagging strands.Results: Analysis of 185 representative bacterial chromosomes showed diverse and characteristic patterns of skews among different clades. The base composition skews in the coding sequences were used to derive quantitatively the effect of replication-driven mutation plus subsequent selection ('replication-associated pressure', RAP), and the effect of transcription-driven mutation plus subsequent selection at translation level ('transcription-associate pressure', TAP). While different clades exhibit distinct patterns of RAP and TAP, RAP is absent or nearly absent in some bacteria, but TAP is present in all. The selection pressure at the translation level is evident in all bacteria based on the analysis of the skews at the three codon positions. Contribution of asymmetric cytosine deamination was found to be weak to TAP in most phyla, and strong to RAP in all the Proteobacteria but weak in most of the Firmicutes. This possibly reflects the differences in their chromosomal replication machineries. A strong negative correlation between TAP and G+C content and between TAP and chromosomal size were also revealed.Conclusion: The study reveals the diverse mutation and selection forces associated with replication and transcription in various groups of bacteria that shape the distinct patterns of base composition skews in the chromosomes during evolution. Some closely relative species with distinct base composition parameters are uncovered in this study, which also provides opportunities for comparative bioinformatic and genetic investigations to uncover the underlying principles for mutation and selection. },

The first parameter correlates With genome GC content, and the second parameter correlates with context-dependent nucleotide bias. Both of these parameters may be calculated from intergenic sequences. Therefore, genome-wide codon bias in eubacterial and archaea may be predicted from intergenic sequences that are not translated. When these two parameters are calculated for genes from nonmammalian eukaryotic organisms, genes from the same organism again have similar values, and genome-wide codon bias may also be predicted from intergenic sequences. in mammals, genes from the same organism are similar only in the second parameter, because GC content varies widely among isochores. Our results suggest that, in general, genome-wide codon bias is determined primarily by mutational processes that act throughout the genome, and only secondarily by selective forces acting on translated sequences. },

This result also gives the approximated null distribution of the test statistic. For practical sample sizes, the adequacy of the large-sample approximation to the null distribution of the test statistic are carefully examined. Power comparisons with other goodness-of-fit tests are performed to show the advantages of the new method.

We profiled gene expression using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays in the BXD recombinant inbred strains, for which we have extensive SNP and haplotype data. We integrated a complementary database comprising 25 years of legacy phenotypic data on these strains. Covariance among gene expression and pharmacological and behavioral traits is often highly significant, corroborates known functional relations and is often generated by common quantitative trait loci. We found that a small number of major-effect quantitative trait loci jointly modulated large sets of transcripts and classical neural phenotypes in patterns specific to each tissue. We developed new analytic and graph theoretical approaches to study shared genetic modulation of networks of traits using gene sets involved in neural synapse function as an example. We built these tools into an open web resource called WebQTL that can be used to test a broad array of hypotheses.},

New drugs are being invented for both chemoprophylaxis and therapeutic treatments and their use is discussed along side that of the more commonly used treatments. Classical genetic crosses coupled with molecular analysis of gene loci are use to explain the genetics behind the development of specific drug resistances that the parasites have naturally developed. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing techniques have allowed the compete sequencing of the P. falciparum and several other rodent malaria parasite genomes. Proteomics and computational analysis of these vast databanks are being used to model and investigate the three-dimensional structure of many key malaria proteins in an attempt to facilitate drug design. Recombinant protein expression in bacteria and yeast coupled with cGMP purification technologies and conditions have lead to the recent availability of several dozen malaria protein antigens for human-use Phase I and Phase 11 vaccine trials. Drug companies, private foundations, and key government agencies have contributed to the coordinated efforts needed to test these antigens, adjuvants and delivery methods in an effort to find an effective malaria vaccine that will prevent infection and disease.},

In the model, these effects act via the solvent accessibility environments and pairwise amino acid interactions that are induced by tertiary structure. To compare the hypotheses that structure does and does not have a strong influence on evolution, Bayes factors were estimated for each of the 1,195 sequences. Most of the Bayes factors strongly support the hypothesis that protein structure affects protein evolution. Furthermore, both solvent accessibility and pairwise interactions among amino acids are inferred to have important roles in protein evolution. Our results also indicate that the strength of the relationship between tertiary structure and evolution has a weak but real correlation to the annotation information in the Gene Ontology database.

  Abstract                 = {Models of molecular evolution tend to be overly simplistic caricatures of biology that are prone to assigning high probabilities to biologically implausible DNA or protein sequences. Here, we explore how to construct time-reversible evolutionary models that yield stationary distributions of sequences that match given target distributions. By adopting comparatively realistic target distributions, evolutionary models can be improved. Instead of focusing on estimating parameters, we concentrate on the population genetic implications of these models. Specifically, we obtain estimates of the product of effective population size and relative fitness difference of alleles. The approach is illustrated with two applications to protein-coding DNA. In the first, a codon-based evolutionary model yields a stationary distribution of sequences, which, when the sequences are translated, matches a variable-length Markov model trained on human proteins. In the second, we introduce an insertion-deletion model that describes selectively neutral evolutionary changes to DNA. We then show how to modify the neutral model so that its stationary distribution at the amino acid level can match a profile hidden Markov model, such as the one associated with the Pfam database.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the inference of which of two alleles is ancestral when the alleles have a single nonsynonymous difference and when natural selection acts via protein tertiary structure. Whereas the probability that an allele is ancestral under neutrality is equal to its frequency, under selection this probability depends on allele frequency and on the magnitude and direction of selection pressure. Although allele frequencies can be well estimated from intraspecific data, small fitness differences have a large evolutionary impact but can be difficult to estimate with only intraspecific data. Methods for predicting aspects of phenotype from genotype can supplement intraspecific sequence data. Recently developed statistical techniques can assess effects of phenotypes, such as protein tertiary structure on molecular evolution. While these techniques were initially designed for comparing protein-coding genes from different species, the resulting interspecific inferences can be assigned population genetic interpretations to assess the effect of selection pressure, and we use them here along with intraspecific allele frequency data to estimate the probability that an allele is ancestral. We focus on 140 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms of humans that are in proteins with known tertiary structures. We find that our technique for employing protein tertiary structure information yields some biologically plausible results but that it does not substantially improve the inference of ancestral human allele types.

  Abstract                 = {We explore and quantify the physical and biochemical mechanisms that may be relevant in the regulation of translation. After elongation and detachment from the 39 termination site of mRNA, parts of the ribosome machinery can diffuse back to the initiation site, especially if it is held nearby, enhancing overall translation rates. The elongation steps of the mRNA-bound ribosomes are modeled using exact and asymptotic results of the totally asymmetric exclusion process. Since the ribosome injection rates of the totally asymmetric exclusion process depend on the local concentrations at the initiation site, a source of ribosomes emanating from the termination end can feed back to the initiation site, leading to a self-consistent set of equations for the steady-state ribosome throughput. Additional mRNA binding factors can also promote loop formation, or cyclization, bringing the initiation and termination sites into close proximity. The probability distribution of the distance between the initiation and termination sites is described using simple noninteracting polymer models. We find that the initiation, or initial ribosome adsorption binding required for maximal throughput, can vary dramatically depending on certain values of the bulk ribosome concentration and diffusion constant. If cooperative interactions among the loop-promoting proteins and the initiation/termination sites are considered, the throughput can be further regulated in a nonmonotonic manner. Experiments that can potentially test the hypothesized physical mechanisms are discussed. },

Using a coherent set of traits in an organism familiar to the students makes it easy to illustrate principles of transmission and population genetics. The one-semester course consists primarily of sophomores and juniors who have either taken a one-semester introductory biology course, a one-semester cell biology course, or have a strong high school biology background. The students are given a handout and asked to determine the genotype at seven unlinked loci of at least one cat. To fill out the form, the students have to grasp such concepts as dominance, incomplete dominance, temperature-sensitive mutations, epistatic interactions, sex linkage, and variable expressivity. Completing the form reinforces these concepts as they observe the cat's phenotype and fill in the genotype. I then analyze the collected data and use it in my lectures on population genetics to illustrate the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, calculate allele frequencies, and use statistics. This allows the students to look at population genetics in a very positive light and provides concrete examples of some often misunderstood principles. },

Five pigs from each group were killed 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks after the first inoculation (p.i.) to determine their worm burdens. Weekly faecal egg counts were determined. At slaughter, worms were counted, differentiated according to sex and developmental stage, and their length measured. Faecal egg counts ranked with dose rate until week 15, but later were more variable. The proportion of the total number of L, administered which were recovered at slaughter inversely ranked with dose rate. In group C it decreased over time, whereas in groups A and B there was no consistent pattern. Worm fecundities (epg/female) in groups A and B were higher than in group C. The lengths of the female worms increased over time, whereas the lengths of the male worms remained approximately constant from week 8. The study suggests reduced establishment of incoming larvae and lower fecundity of the female worms at high dose levels. }

Adult worms from the low dose group A were significantly longer than these from group C.

Because of the finite nature of the resources required by the translational machinery, both the overall protein synthesis activity of a cell and activity on individual mRNAs are controlled by the allocation of limiting resources. Upon introduction of heterologous sequences into an organism-for example for the purposes of bioprocessing or synthetic biology-limiting resources may also become overstretched, thus negatively affecting both endogenous and heterologous gene expression. In this study, we present a mean-field model of translation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the investigation of two particular translational resources, namely ribosomes and aminoacylated tRNAs. We firstly use comparisons of experiments with heterologous sequences and simulations of the same conditions to calibrate our model, and then analyse the behaviour of the translational system in yeast upon introduction of different types of heterologous sequences. Our main findings are that: competition for ribosomes, rather than tRNAs, limits global translation in this organism; that tRNA aminoacylation levels exert, at most, weak control over translational activity; and that decoding speeds and codon adaptation exert strong control over local (mRNA specific) translation rates.},

The evolutionary selection of codons whose properties are optimal for a cell generates the phenomenon of codon bias. Although recent studies have shown strong effects of codon usage changes on protein expression levels and cellular physiology, no translational control mechanism is known that links codon usage to protein expression levels. Here, we demonstrate a novel translational control mechanism that responds to the speed of ribosome movement immediately after the start codon. High initiation rates are only possible if start codons are liberated sufficiently fast, thus accounting for the observation that fast codons are overrepresented in highly expressed proteins. In contrast, slow codons lead to slow liberation of the start codon by initiating ribosomes, thereby interfering with efficient translation initiation. Codon usage thus evolved as a means to optimise translation on individual mRNAs, as well as global optimisation of ribosome availability.},

After reviewing the substantial body of formal theory underpinning these predictions, we outline how this account organizes diverse empirical findings in the cognitive sciences and related disciplines.

  Abstract                 = {Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a phylogenetic framework dramatically improves the precision and sensitivity of evolutionary inference, producing more robust results than single-genome analyses can provide. The genomes of 12 {D}rosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made {D}rosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these {D}rosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding {RNA} genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species. },

  Abstract                 = {Although spatial patterns of seed distribution are thought to vary greatly among plant species dispersed by different vectors, few studies have directly examined this assumption. We compared patterns of seed rain of nine species of trees disseminated by large birds, monkeys, and wind in a closed canopy forest in Cameroon. We used maximum-likelihood methods to fit seed rain data to four dispersal functions: inverse power, negative exponential, Gaussian, and Student t. We then tested for differences in dispersal characteristics (1) among individuals within species, and (2) among species dispersed by the same vector. In general, an inverse power function best described animal-dispersed species and the Gaussian and Student t functions best described wind-dispersed species. Animal-dispersed species had longer mean dispersal distances than wind-dispersed species, but lower fecundities. In addition to these distinct differences in average dispersal distance and functional form of the seed shadow between animaland wind-dispersed species, seed shadows varied markedly within species and vector, with conspecifics and species within vector varying in their dispersal scale, fecundity, and clumping parameters. Dispersal vectors determine a significant amount of variation in seed distribution, but much variation remains to be explained. Finally, we demonstrate that most seeds, regardless of vector, fall directly under the parent canopy. Long-distance dispersal events (>60 m) account for a small proportion of the seed crop but may still be important in terms of the absolute numbers of dispersed seeds and effects on population and community dynamics. }

Two strains are compared, strain N16961 and a Latin American El Tor strain C3294. The consensus map contains 340 spots consistently seen with both strains grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) or minimal M9 medium. The results were obtained from nine gels run with 18 cm immobilized pH gradient strips and precast gels. The 2-D gels were anchored to real N16961 proteins identified by mass spectrometry. Various energy metabolism components and periplasmic ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins were identified among the abundant proteins. Two isoforms of OmpU were found. Five operons are proposed and seven hypothetical proteins were experimentally confirmed. Comparisons are made with protein 2-D gels for a classical strain and to microarray analysis available for the N16961 El Tor strain. New results were obtained from the proteome analysis, indicating an abundance of periplasmic ABC transporter proteins not found in microarray studies.},

These results lead to a simple steady-state model in which infection, cell death, and cell replacement are in balance, and imply that the unique feature of HIV is the extraordinarily large number of replication cycles that occur during infection of a single individual. This turnover drives both the pathogenic process and (even more than mutation rate) the development of genetic variation. This variation includes the inevitable and, in principle, predictable accumulation of mutations such as those conferring resistance to antiviral drugs whose presence before therapy must be considered in the design of therapeutic strategies,},

  Abstract                 = {In 1982, Ikemura reported a strikingly unequal usage of different synonymous codons, in five Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear genes having high protein levels. To study this trend in detail, we examined data from three independent studies that used oligonucleotide arrays or SAGE to estimate {mRNA} concentrations for nearly all genes in the genome. Correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship of {mRNA} concentration to four commonly used measures of synonymous codon usage bias: the codon adaptation index (CAI), the codon bias index (CBI), the frequency of optimal codons (F-op), and the effective number of codons (N-c). {mRNA} concentration was best approximated as an exponential function of each of these four measures. Of the four, the CAI was the most strongly correlated with {mRNA} concentration (r(s)=0.62+/-0.01, n=2525, p<10(-17)). When we controlled for CAI, {mRNA} concentration and protein length were negatively correlated (partial r(s)=-0.23 +/- 0.01, n = 4765, p < 10(-17)). This may result from selection to reduce the size of abundant proteins to minimize transcriptional and translational costs. When we controlled for {mRNA} concentration, protein length and CAI were positively correlated (partial r(s)=0.16+/-0.01, n=4765, p<10(-17)). This may reflect more effective selection in longer genes against missense errors during translation. The correlation coefficients between the {mRNA} levels of individual genes, as measured by different investigators and methods, were low, in the range r(s)=0.39-0.68.

  Abstract                 = {It is known that there are several codes residing simultaneously on the DNA double helix. The two best-characterized codes are the genetic code-the code for protein production, and the code for DNA packaging into nucleosomes. Since these codes have to coexist simultaneously on the same DNA region, both must be degenerate to allow this coexistence. A-tracts are homopolymeric stretches of several adjacent deoxyadenosines on one strand of the double helix, having unusual structural properties, which were shown to exclude nucleosomes and as such are instrumental in setting the translational positioning of DNA within nucleosomes. We observe, cross-kingdoms, a strong codon bias toward the avoidance of long A-tracts in exon regions, which enables the formation of high density of nucleosomes in these regions. Moreover, long A-tract avoidance is restricted exclusively to nucleosome-occupied exon regions. We show that this bias in codon usage is sufficient for enabling DNA organization within nucleosomes without constraints on the actual code for proteins. Thus, there is interdependency of the two major codes within DNA to allow their coexistence. Furthermore, we show that modulation of A-tract occurrences in exon versus non-exon regions may result in a unique alternation of the diameter of the '30-nm' fiber model.},

  Abstract                 = {In mammalian meiosis, only a small fraction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks are repaired as interhomolog crossovers (COs). To analyze another product of meiotic recombination, interhomolog noncrossovers (NCOs), we performed high-resolution mapping of recombination events at an intensely active mouse hot spot in F1 hybrids derived from inbred mouse strains. We provide direct evidence that the vast majority of repair events are interhomolog NCOs, consistent with models in which frequent interhomolog interactions promote accurate chromosome pairing. NCOs peaked at the center of the hot spot but were also broadly distributed throughout. In some hybrid strains, localized zones within the hot spot were highly refractory to COs and showed elevated frequency of coconversion of adjacent polymorphisms in NCOs, raising the possibility of double-strand gap repair.

Underrepresented codon pairs caused decreased rates of protein translation, and polioviruses containing such amino acid-independent changes were attenuated in mice. Polioviruses thus customized were used to immunize mice and provided protective immunity after challenge. This "death by a thousand cuts" strategy could be generally applicable to attenuating many kinds of viruses.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent large-scale genomic and evolutionary studies have revealed the small but detectable signature of weak selection on synonymous mutations during mammalian evolution, likely acting at the level of translational efficacy (i.e., translational selection). To investigate whether weak selection, and translational selection in particular, plays any role in shaping the fate of synonymous mutations that are present today in human populations, we studied genetic variation at the polymorphic level and patterns of evolution in the human lineage after human-chimpanzee separation. We find evidence that neutral mechanisms are influencing the frequency of polymorphic mutations in humans. Our results suggest a recent increase in mutational tendencies toward AT, observed in all isochores, that is responsible for AT mutations segregating at lower frequencies than GC mutations. In all, however, changes in mutational tendencies and other neutral scenarios are not sufficient to explain a difference between synonymous and noncoding mutations or a difference between synonymous mutations potentially advantageous or deleterious under a translational selection model. Furthermore, several estimates of selection intensity on synonymous mutations all suggest a detectable influence of weak selection acting at the level of translational selection. Thus, random genetic drift, recent changes in mutational tendencies, and weak selection influence the fate of synonymous mutations that are present today as polymorphisms. All of these features, neutral and selective, should be taken into account in evolutionary analyses that often assume constancy of mutational tendencies and complete neutrality of synonymous mutations. },

  Abstract                 = {Natural selection influences synonymous mutations and synonymous codon usage in many eukaryotes to improve the efficiency of translation in highly expressed genes. Recent studies of gene composition in eukaryotes have shown that codon usage also varies independently of expression levels, both among genes and at the intragenic level. Here, we investigate rates of evolution (Ks) and intensity of selection ({gamma}s) on synonymous mutations in two groups of genes that differ greatly in the length of their exons, but with equivalent levels of gene expression and rates of crossing-over in Drosophila melanogaster. We estimate {gamma}s using patterns of divergence and polymorphism in 50 Drosophila genes (100 kb of coding sequence) to take into account possible variation in mutation trends across the genome, among genes or among codons. We show that genes with long exons exhibit higher Ks and reduced {gamma}s compared to genes with short exons. We also show that Ks and {gamma}s vary significantly across long exons, with higher Ks and reduced {gamma}s in the central region compared to flanking regions of the same exons, hence indicating that the difference between genes with short and long exons can be mostly attributed to the central region of these long exons. Although amino acid composition can also play a significant role when estimating Ks and {gamma}s, our analyses show that the differences in Ks and {gamma}s between genes with short and long exons and across long exons cannot be explained by differences in protein composition. All these results are consistent with the Interference Selection (IS) model that proposes that the Hill-Robertson (HR) effect caused by many weakly selected mutations has detectable evolutionary consequences at the intragenic level in genomes with recombination. Under the IS model, exon size and exon-intron structure influence the effectiveness of selection, with long exons showing reduced effectiveness of selection when compared to small exons and the central region of long exons showing reduced intensity of selection compared to flanking coding regions. Finally, our results further stress the need to consider selection on synonymous mutations and its variation--among and across genes and exons--in studies of protein evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Weakly selected mutations are most likely to be physically clustered across genomes and, when sufficiently linked, they alter each others' fixation probability, a process we call interference selection (IS). Here we study population genetics and evolutionary consequences of IS on the selected mutations themselves and on adjacent selectively neutral variation. We show that IS reduces levels of polymorphism and increases low-frequency variants and linkage disequilibrium, in both selected and adjacent neutral mutations. IS can account for several well-documented patterns of variation and composition in genomic regions with low rates of crossing over in Drosophila. IS cannot be described simply as a reduction in the efficacy of selection and effective population size in standard models of selection and drift. Rather, IS can be better understood with models that incorporate a constant "traffic" of competing alleles. Our simulations also allow us to make genome-wide predictions that are specific to IS. We show that IS will be more severe at sites in the center of a region containing weakly selected mutations than at sites located close to the edge of the region. Drosophila melanogaster genomic data strongly support this prediction, with genes without introns showing significantly reduced codon bias in the center of coding regions. As expected, if introns relieve IS, genes with centrally located introns do not shore reduced codon bias in the center of the coding region. We also show that reasonably small differences in the length of intermediate "neutral" sequences embedded in a region under selection increase the effectiveness of selection on the adjacent selected sequences. Hence, the presence and length of sequences such as introns or intergenic regions can be a trait subject to selection in recombining genomes. In support of this prediction, intron presence is positively correlated with a gene's codon bias in D. melanogaster. Finally, the study of temporal dynamics of IS after a change of recombination rate shows that nonequilibrium codon usage may be the norm rather than the exception.},

We do so for the complete genomes of four eukaryotes (fission and budding yeast, fruit fly and nematode) and one prokaryote (Escherichia coli). For some classes of genes we observe a strong relationship between gene function and a gene's propensity to undergo duplication. Most notably, ribosomal genes and transcription factors appear less likely to undergo gene duplication than other genes. In both fission and budding yeast, we see a strong positive correlation between the selective constraint on a gene and the size of the gene family of which this gene is a member. In contrast, a weakly negative such correlation is seen in multicellular eukaryotes.},

The first divides the amino acids into groups, with one substitution rate for pairs of residues in the same group and a second for those in differing groups. Unlike previous applications of this model, the groups themselves are estimated from data by simulated annealing. The second model makes substitution rates a function of the physical and chemical similarity between two residues. Because we model the evolution of coding DNA sequences as opposed to protein sequences, artifacts arising from the differing numbers of nucleotide substitutions required to bring about various amino acid substitutions are avoided. Using 10 alignments of related sequences (five of orthologous genes and five gene families), we do find differences in substitution patterns. We also find that, although patterns of amino acid substitution vary temporally within the history of a gene, variation is not greater in paralogous than in orthologous genes. Improved understanding of such gene-specific variation in substitution patterns may have implications for applications such as sequence alignment and phylogenctic inference. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we use genome-wide SNP data from the HapMap and CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel samples to study the geographic distributions of putatively selected alleles at a range of geographic scales. We find that the average allele frequency divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme F(ST) values across the whole genome. On a broad scale, the geographic distribution of putatively selected alleles almost invariably conforms to population clusters identified using randomly chosen genetic markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human populations. Among the nearly fixed differences that do exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that occurred outside of Africa, and most appear in East Asia. These patterns suggest that selection is often weak enough that neutral processes-especially population history, migration, and drift exert powerful influences over the fate and geographic distribution of selected alleles.},

An entire universe of problems that in the past had been addressed only through conjecture, including whole genome analysis, can now be studied directly. The rapidity and scope of these changes in research capacity have in turn led to speculation that medicine will be radically altered by the application of genomics to everyday practice. To date, gene therapy and several new tests for genetic susceptibility have been successfully implemented, although their impact on medicine as a whole remains very limited and their future contribution is hotly contested. The potential of molecular genetics, like all technology, must be evaluated on the basis of established principles of clinical and epidemiologic research. The rhetoric of some enthusiasts focuses instead on an optimistic best-case scenario of the future of DNA science, and many of their most far-reaching claims cannot be substantiated on the basis of what is currently known. The tension between the long-term goal of public health and medicine to identify and remove the causes of ill health, in contrast to the development of technological innovations that can cure disease or identify individual susceptibility, emerges as a major theme in this debate.},

  Abstract                 = {High-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to obtain a protein profile of \emph{Escherichia coli} strain MG1655 grown in minimal medium with glycerol as the carbon source. By using cell lysate from only 3 x 10(8) cells, at least four different tryptic peptides were detected for each of 404 proteins in a short 4-h experiment. At least one peptide with a high reliability score was detected for 986 proteins. Because membrane proteins were under-represented, a second experiment was performed with a preparation enriched in membranes. An additional 161 proteins were detected, of which from half to two-thirds were membrane proteins. Overall, 1,147 different E coli proteins were identified, almost 4 times as many as had been identified previously by using other tools. The protein list was compared with the transcription profile obtained on Affymetrix GeneChips. Expression of 1,113 (97\%) of the genes whose protein products were found was detected at the {mRNA} level. The arithmetic mean {mRNA} signal intensity for these genes was 3-fold higher than that for all 4,300 protein-coding genes of E coli. Thus, GeneChip data confirmed the high reliability of the protein list, which contains about one-fourth of the proteins of E coli. Detection of even those membrane proteins and proteins of undefined function that are encoded by the same operons (transcriptional units) encoding proteins on the list remained low. }

A more biologically realistic model also demonstrates that this effect could explain the rapid observed spread of recessive or weakly dominant drug-resistant genotypes in nematode parasites of sheep. This promotion of a recessive trait arises from a novel mechanism of inbreeding arising from the metapopulation dynamics of transmission. }

The altered region corresponds to a turn between two short alpha helices. One of the silent mutations of EgFABP1 markedly decreased the solubility of the protein when expressed in \emph{{E}scherichia coli}. Expression of this protein also caused strong activation of a reporter gene designed to detect misfolded proteins, suggesting that the turn region seems to have special translation kinetic requirements that ensure proper folding of the protein.

  Abstract                 = {Whether and how human populations exposed to the agricultural revolution are still affected by Darwinian selection remains controversial among social scientists, biologists, and the general public. Although methods of studying selection in natural populations are well established, our understanding of selection in humans has been limited by the availability of suitable datasets. Here, we present a study comparing the maximum strengths of natural and sexual selection in humans that includes the effects of sex and wealth on different episodes of selection. Our dataset was compiled from church records of preindustrial Finnish populations characterized by socially imposed monogamy, and it contains a complete distribution of survival, mating, and reproductive success for 5,923 individuals born 1760-1849. Individual differences in early survival and fertility (natural selection) were responsible for most variation in fitness, even among wealthier individuals. Variance in mating success explained most of the higher variance in reproductive success in males compared with females, but mating success also influenced reproductive success in females, allowing for sexual selection to operate in both sexes. The detected opportunity for selection is in line with measurements for other species but higher than most previous reports for human samples. This disparity results from biological, demographic, economic, and social differences across populations as well as from failures by most previous studies to account for variation in fitness introduced by nonreproductive individuals. Our results emphasize that the demographic, cultural, and technological changes of the last 10,000 y did not preclude the potential for natural and sexual selection in our species.},

Two Australian studies used experimentally-infected plots to determine hatching, development and survival of free living stages of equine cyathostomes, Four studies in the southern United States used pasture larval counts, and in some instances tracer animals, to determine seasonal availability of infective cyathostome larvae on naturally-infected pastures. With the exception of the dry Australian tropics, a general pattern of peak transmission of cyathostomes during the cooler seasons of the: year and minimal transmission during the warmest seasons was observed. Infective larvae and developing stages survived poorly in hot weather, although the rate of development was most rapid during that time. In contrast, infective larvae and developing stages survived well in cool weather, although the rate of development was slower. Adequate moisture was crucial to cyathostome transmission in warm climates, thus hot, dry weather effectively sterilized a pasture, whereas cool, moist weather was optimum for transmission. These data suggest that suppression of cyathostome egg output in feces of horses beginning shortly before the onset of cooler and/or more moist weather, and continued through the favorable period for development and survival of larvae on pasture - usually the autumn and winter should provide adequate control of these parasites. However, the efficacy of such seasonal control programs has yet to be adequately tested against that of traditional year round treatments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract                 = {The flood of high-throughput biological data has led to the expectation that computational ( or in silico) models can be used to direct biological discovery, enabling biologists to reconcile heterogeneous data types, find inconsistencies and systematically generate hypotheses(1-3). Such a process is fundamentally iterative, where each iteration involves making model predictions, obtaining experimental data, reconciling the predicted outcomes with experimental ones, and using discrepancies to update the in silico model. Here we have reconstructed, on the basis of information derived from literature and databases, the first integrated genome-scale computational model of a transcriptional regulatory and metabolic network. The model accounts for 1,010 genes in \emph{{E}scherichia coli}, including 104 regulatory genes whose products together with other stimuli regulate the expression of 479 of the 906 genes in the reconstructed metabolic network. This model is able not only to predict the outcomes of high-throughput growth phenotyping and gene expression experiments, but also to indicate knowledge gaps and identify previously unknown components and interactions in the regulatory and metabolic networks. We find that a systems biology approach that combines genome-scale experimentation and computation can systematically generate hypotheses on the basis of disparate data sources.},

Our review of both theory and data led us to reject the idea that Wright's shifting balance process has played a major role in adaptive evolution. We supported instead the view of Darwin (is quantified by Fisher) that the main engine of adaptation is natural selection acting on differences among individuals-without genetic drift, population subdivision, and differential migration playing the vital roles hypothesized by the SBT. Peck et al. (1998) and Wade and Goodnight (1998) each claim that our dismissal of the SBT is premature. Peck et al. (1998) offer a theoretical defense of Wright, claiming that phase III (the movement of populations to higher adaptive peaks) may act more frequently than we proposed. Wade and Goodnight, on the ether hand, defend the SBT by discussing experimental studies of group selection and aspects of population subdivision and epistasis. Here we respond to both papers, and conclude that neither offers substantial support for the SBT.},

This type of increased gene dosage confers selectable benefits, typically by augmenting protein production. Gene amplification is a reversible process that does not require permanent genetic change. Although transient, altered gene dosage has significant medical impact. Recent examples of amplification in bacteria, described here, affect human disease by modifying antibiotic resistance, the virulence of pathogens, vaccine efficacy and antibiotic biosynthesis. Amplification is usually a two-step process whereby genetic duplication (step one) promotes further increases in copy number (step two). Both steps have important evolutionary significance for the emergence of innovative gene functions. Recent genome sequence analyses illustrate how genome plasticity can affect the evolution and immunogenic properties of bacterial pathogens.},

Evidence from comparative primatology, anthropology, physiology and human disorders indicates that child health risks have evolved in the context of evolutionary changes, along the human lineage, affecting the timing, growth-differentiation phenotypes and adaptive significance of prenatal stages, infancy, childhood, juvenility and adolescence. The most striking evolutionary changes in humans are earlier weaning and prolonged subsequent pre-adult stages, which have structured and potentiated maladaptations related to growth and development. Data from human genetic and epigenetic studies, and mouse models, indicate that growth, development and behaviour during pre-adult stages are mediated to a notable degree by effects from genomic conflicts and imprinted genes. The incidence of cancer, the primary cause of non-infectious childhood mortality, mirrors child growth rates from birth to adolescence, with paediatric cancer development impacted by imprinted genes that control aspects of growth. Understanding the adaptive significance of child growth and development phenotypes, in the context of human-evolutionary changes and genomic conflicts, provides novel insights into the causes of disease in childhood.},

We have conducted the first comprehensive assessment of the extent and patterns of positive Darwinian selection on intellectual disability genes in humans. We report three main findings. First, as noted in some previous reports, intellectual disability genes with primary functions in the central nervous system exhibit a significant concentration to the X chromosome. Second, there was no evidence for a higher incidence of recent positive selection on X-linked than autosomal intellectual disability genes, nor was there a higher incidence of selection on such genes overall, compared to sets of control genes. However, the X-linked intellectual disability genes inferred to be subject to recent positive selection were concentrated in the Rho GTP-ase pathway, a key signaling pathway in neural development and function. Third, among all intellectual disability genes, there was evidence for a higher incidence of recent positive selection on genes involved in DNA repair, but not for genes involved in other functions. These results provide evidence that alterations to genes in the Rho GTP-ase and DNA-repair pathways may play especially-important roles in the evolution of human cognition and vulnerability to genetically-based intellectual disability. },

  Abstract                 = {The Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler coined the terms "schizophrenia", for the splitting of psychic functions, and "autism", for withdrawal from external reality in patients with schizophrenia, almost exactly a century ago. Ever since 1943 when Leo Kanner co-opted "autism" to refer to a new condition involving "disturbance of affective contact" manifested in children, the relationship between schizophrenia and Kanner's autism has remained unclear. In this article I draw on data from studies of genomics, neurodevelopment, psychology, psychiatry and evolutionary biology to develop and evaluate alternative hypotheses for the relationship between autism and schizophrenia spectrum conditions. These data provide evidence for two hypotheses: partially-overlapping etiology of autism with schizophrenia mediated by common risk factors, and diametric causes of autism and schizophrenia mediated by genes underlying under-development versus dysregulated over-development of human social-brain phenotypes. The primary practical implications of these results are that: (1) false-positive diagnoses of premorbidity to schizophrenia-spectrum conditions as autistic spectrum conditions may be common, and may indicate a structural flaw in current diagnostic, nosological frameworks; (2) schizophrenia may be due in part to losses of function in negative regulators of social cognition and affect, rather than "deficits" in brain development; (3) the development of new pharmacological treatments for autism and schizophrenia can benefit directly from models of how autistic spectrum and schizophrenia spectrum conditions are etiologically related; and (4) future studies of autism, schizophrenia, and their relationship to one another must increasingly seek to integrate across analytic levels, from genes to neurodevelopment, neurological function, neuroanatomy, cognition, and evolutionary biology of the social brain, in the context of subtyping the substantial genetic and clinical heterogeneity found in each set of conditions. },

I first provide an overview of models for the origins and maintenance of genetically based disease risk in humans. I then discuss how analyses of genetic disease risk can be dovetailed with studies of positive and balancing selection, to evaluate the degree to which the 'genes that make us human' also represent the genes that mediate risk of polygenic disease. Finally, I present four basic principles for the nascent field of human evolutionary medical genomics, each of which represents a process that is nonintuitive from a proximate perspective. Joint consideration of these principles compels novel forms of interdisciplinary analyses, most notably studies that (i) analyze tradeoffs at the level of molecular genetics, and (ii) identify genetic variants that are derived in the human lineage or in specific populations, and then compare individuals with derived versus ancestral alleles. },

When these phages were forced to grow again on Escherichia, fitness recovery occurred predominantly by reversions at these same sites, rather than by second-site compensatory changes, the more frequently observed mechanism in most microbial systems. The affected residues lie on the virion surface and they alter attachment efficiency, yet they occur iu a region distinct from a putative binding region previously identified from X-ray crystallography. These residues not only experienced high rates of evolution in our experiments, but also exhibited high levels of radical amino acid variation among phi X174 and its known relatives, consistent with a history of adaptation involving these sites.},

Recent studies have shed light on how meiotic crossovers and other recombination products form, how their position and number are regulated and how the DNA molecules undergoing recombination are chosen. These studies indicate that the long-dominant, unifying model of recombination proposed by Szostak et al applies, with modification, only to a subset of recombination events. Instead, crossover formation and its control involve multiple pathways, with considerable variation among model organisms.

The codon sequences of the 'mini-ORFs' employed were initiator, combinations of AGA and CGA, and terminator. Both, AGA and CGA are low-usage Arg codons in ORFs of \emph{Escherichia coli} but, whilst AGA is translated by the scarce {tRNA}(Arg4), CGA is recognized by the abundant {tRNA}(Arg2). Overexpression of minigenes harbouring AGA in the third position, next to a termination codon, was deleterious to the cell and led to the accumulation of peptidyl-{tRNA}(Arg4) and of the peptidyl-{tRNA} cognate to the preceding CGA or AGA Arg triplet. The minigenes carrying CGA in the third position were not toxic. Minigene-mediated toxicity and peptidyl-{tRNA} accumulation were suppressed by overproduction of {tRNA}(Arg4) but not by overproduction of peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase, an enzyme that is only active on substrates that have been released from the ribosome. Consistent with these findings, peptidyl-{tRNA}(Arg4) was identified to be mainly associated with ribosomes in a stand-by complex. These and previous results support the hypothesis that the primary mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis by AGA triplets in pth(+) cells involves sequestration of {tRNA}s as peptidyl-{tRNA} on the stalled ribosome. }

The new statistic is compared with other statistics used to test for differential expression: the gene-specific F test (F-1), the pooled-variance F statistic (F-3), a hybrid statistic (F-2) that uses the average of the individual and pooled variances, the regularized t-statistic, the posterior odds statistic B. and the SAM t-test. The F-S-test shows best or newly best power for detecting differentially expressed genes over a wide range of simulated data in which the variance components associated with individual genes are either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Thus F-S provides a powerful and robust approach to test differential expression of genes that utilizes information not available in individual gene testing approaches and does not suffer from biases of the pooled variance approach. },

  Abstract                 = {{tRNA}s with inosine (I) in the first position read three codons ending in U, C and A, However, A-ending codons read with I are rarely used, in Escherichia coil, CGA/U/C are all read solely by {tRNA}(lCG)(Arg). CGU and CGC are very common codons, but CGA is very rare, Three independent \emph{in vivo} assays show that translation of CGA is relatively inefficient, in the first, nine tandem CGA cause a strong rho-mediated polar effect on expression of a lacZ reporter gene, the inhibition is made more extreme by a mutation in ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL), which indicates that ribosomal binding by {tRNA}(ICG)(Arg) is slow and/or unstable in the CGA cluster, the second assay, in which codons are substituted for the regulatory UGA of the RF2 frameshift, confirms that aa-{tRNA} selection is slow and/or unstable at CGA. In the third assay, CGA is found to be a poor 5' context for amber suppression, which suggests that an A:I base pair in the P site can interfere with translation of a codon in the A site. Two possible errors, frameshifting and premature termination by RF2, are not significant causes for inefficiency at CGA. It is concluded that the A:I pair destabilizes codon:anticodon complexes during two successive ribosomal cycles, and it is suggested that these properties contribute to the rare usage of codons read with the A:I base pair. },

  Abstract                 = {The burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) disease and efforts to control infection will determine the future size of the population requiring treatment of HBV infection. To quantify the current prevalence of HBV infection and to reexamine the epidemiology of HBV infection, a structured review was conducted that focused on available primary literature for over 30 countries worldwide. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection continues to be highly variable, ranging over 10\% in some Asian and Western Pacific countries to under 0.5\% in the United States and northern European countries. The current global estimate of the number of HBV infected individuals is 350 million. Routes of transmission include vertical (mother to child or generation to generation through close contact and sanitary habits), early life horizontal transmission (through bites, lesions, and sanitary habits), and adult horizontal transmission (through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, and medical procedure exposure) and are evident to varying degrees in every country. Younger age at acquisition of infection continues to be the most important predictor of chronic carriage. However, the choice of serologic markers, temporal influences, and representativeness of the study population limit comparability of HBV seroprevalence results. HBV vaccination programs will decrease the future global burden of HBV infection and evidence of reduced burden is mounting in country-specific populations, but vaccination programs have still not been implemented in all countries, thereby maintaining reservoirs of infection and continued HBV transmission. Regardless of vaccination, large numbers of persons are infected with HBV or will become infected. Preventing the most severe HBV disease consequences in infected individuals, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, will require appropriate therapeutic agents.}

  Abstract                 = {Despite the degeneracy of the genetic code, whereby different codons encode the same amino acid, alternative codons and amino acids are utilized nonrandomly within and between genomes. Such biases in codon and amino acid usage have been demonstrated extensively in prokaryote genomes and likely reflect a balance between the action of mutation, selection, and genetic drift. Here, we quantify the effects of selection and mutation drift as causes of codon and amino acid-usage bias in a large collection of nematode partial genomes from 37 species spanning approximately 700 Myr of evolution, as inferred from expressed sequence tag (EST) measures of gene expression and from base composition variation. Average G + C content at silent sites among these taxa ranges from 10\% to 63\%, and EST counts range more than 100-fold, underlying marked differences between the identities of major codons and optimal codons for a given species as well as influencing patterns of amino acid abundance among taxa. Few species in our sample demonstrate a dominant role of selection in shaping intragenomic codon-usage biases, and these are principally free living rather than parasitic nematodes. This suggests that deviations in effective population size among species, with small effective sizes among parasites, are partly responsible for species differences in the extent to which selection shapes patterns of codon usage. Nevertheless, a consensus set of optimal codons emerges that is common to most taxa, indicating that, with some notable exceptions, selection for translational efficiency and accuracy favors similar sets of codons regardless of the major codon-usage trends defined by base compositional properties of individual nematode genomes.},

However, cumulative evidence suggests that synonymous substitutions might also induce phenotypic variability by affecting splicing accuracy, translation fidelity, and conformation and function of proteins. tRNA isoacceptors mediate the translation of codons to amino acids, and asymmetric tRNA abundance causes variations in the rate of translation of each single triplet. Consequently, the effect of a silent point mutation in the coding region could be significant due to differential abundances of the cognate tRNA(s), emphasizing the importance of precise assessment of tRNA composition. Here, we provide an overview of the methods used to quantitatively determine the concentrations of tRNA species and discuss synonymous mutations in the context of tRNA composition of the cell, thus providing a new twist on the detrimental impact of the silent mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {Background B Aims: Although hepatitis C virus kinetics and immune determinants during primary infection have been described, the virus-host interplay is not fully understood. We used mathematical modeling to elucidate and quantify virus-host dynamics. Methods: Ten chimpanzees were infected intrahepatically with H77-RNA (n = 3) or intravenously with infected serum. Blood samples were taken 1-3 times per week for 6 months. A new model was fitted to the observed HCV RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) kinetics. Results: After infection, viral levels increased in a biphasic manner with a transient decline in between. This can be explained by a partial block (mean, 91\%) of virion production, possibly due to an endogenous type I interferon response. After reaching maximum levels, a long viral plateau (mean, 6A log cp/mL) can be explained by blind homeostasis and lack of susceptible cells. Modest elevations in ALT levels (21-93 IU/L) were concurrently observed, indicating a shorter half-life of infected versus noninfected hepatocytes (mean ratio, 2.6). Following the ALT flare, viral titers rapidly declined to a lower (mean, 4.5 log cp/mL; n = 6) or undetectable level (n = 4). This decline is compatible with increased cell death (mean minimal estimate half-life, 28.7 days) and non-cytolytic clearance (mean maximal estimate half-life, 24.1 days) of infected cells. Conclusions: Our results quantify virus-host dynamics during primary HCV infection and suggest that endogenous type I interferon slows virus production in the early acute phase. Partial or effective virus control correlates with the half-life of infected cells regulated by both cytolytic and noncytolytic mechanisms.}

In this article, an expanded set of misacylated {tRNA}s and two 2-deoxynucleotide-substituted {mRNA}s are used to demonstrate the presence of a lower threshold in k(off) values for aa-{tRNA} binding to the A site. When a {tRNA} binds sufficiently well to reach this threshold, additional stabilizing effects due to the esterified amino acid or changes in {tRNA} sequence are not observed. However, specificity for different amino acid side chains and the {tRNA} body is observed when {tRNA} binding is sufficiently weaker than this threshold. We propose that uniform aa-{tRNA} binding to the A site may be a consequence of a conformational change in the ribosome, induced by the presence of the appropriate combination of contributions from the anticodon, amino acid and {tRNA} body.},

Throughout the past years many modifications to the original SAGE protocol have been developed, which address several aspects of SAGE, including an increase in sequencing efficiency (deep-SAGE), improved tag-to-transcript mapping of SAGE tags (LongSAGE) and a reduction of the amount of required input RNA (microSAGE). Furthermore, the applications of SAGE have expanded from exclusively transcriptome analysis to now also include genome analysis, identifying genome signature tags that pinpoint transcription factor binding sites throughout the genome (Serial Analysis of Chromatin Occupancy or SACO). The review gives an overview of the main modifications to the SAGE technology that have been developed in the last decade, with a particular focus on the large reduction in the amount of required input RNA that has been achieved in the many SAGE modifications for downscaling or miniaturisation of SAGE (including microSAGE, PCR-SAGE and small amplified RNA-SAGE). The available methods for downscaling or miniaturisation of SAGE and their specific features will be discussed, illustrated by some examples of their application. This reduction in required quantity of input RNA has greatly expanded the possible applications of SAGE, allowing characterisation of global gene expression in material obtained from needle biopsies, small anatomical structures and specific cell types isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting or laser microdissection. },

  Abstract                 = {There is abundant transcription from eukaryotic genomes unaccounted for by protein coding genes. A high-resolution genomewide survey of transcription in a well annotated genome will help relate transcriptional complexity to function. By quantifying RNA expression on both strands of the complete genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a high-density oligonucleotide tiling array, this study identifies the boundary, structure, and level of coding and noncoding transcripts. A total of 85\% of the genome is expressed in rich media. Apart from expected transcripts, we found operon-like transcripts, transcripts from neighboring genes not separated by intergenic regions, and genes with complex transcriptional architecture where different parts of the same gene are expressed at different levels. We mapped the positions of 3' and 5' UTRs of coding genes and identified hundreds of RNA transcripts distinct from annotated genes. These nonannotated transcripts, on average, have lower sequence conservation and lower rates of deletion phenotype than protein coding genes. Many other transcripts overlap known genes in antisense orientation, and for these pairs global correlations were discovered: UTR lengths correlated with gene function, localization, and requirements for regulation; antisense transcripts overlapped 3' UTRs more than 5' UTRs; UTRs with overlapping antisense tended to be longer; and the presence of antisense associated with gene function. These findings may suggest a regulatory role of antisense transcription in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, the data show that even this well studied genome has transcriptional complexity far beyond current annotation. },

This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

  Abstract                 = {A mathematical model is presented that explores the relationship between transmission patterns and the evolution of virulence for horizontally transmitted parasites when only a single parasite strain can infect each host. The model is constructed by decomposing parasite transmission into two processes, the rate of contact between hosts and the probability of transmission per contact. These transmission rate components, as well as the total parasite mortality rate, are allowed to vary over the course of an infection. A general evolutionarily stable condition is presented that partitions the effects of virulence on parasite fitness into three components: fecundity benefits, mortality costs. and morbidity costs. This extension of previous theory allows us to explore the evolutionary consequences of a variety of transmission patterns. I then focus attention on a special case in which the parasite density remains approximately constant during an infection, and I demonstrate two important ways in which transmission modes can affect virulence evolution: by imposing different morbidity costs on the parasite and by altering the scheduling of parasite reproduction during an infection. Both are illustrated with examples. including one that examines the hypothesis that vector-borne parasites should be more virulent than non-vector-borne parasites (Ewald 1994). The validity of this hypothesis depends upon the way in which these two effects interact, and it need not hold in general. },

Indeed, some data do conform to this general pattern. Nevertheless, his hypothesis has generated some debate about the extent to which it is valid. I explore this issue quantitatively within the framework of mathematical epidemiology. In particular, I present a dynamic optimization model for the evolution of parasite replication strategies that explicitly explores the validity of this hypothesis. A few different model assumptions are explored and it is found that Ewald's hypothesis has only qualified support as a general explanation for why vector-borne parasites are more virulent than those that are directly transmitted. I conclude by suggesting that an alternative explanation might lie in differences in inoculum size between these two types of transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {In experimental population ecology, there is often a gap between realistic models used to hypothesize about population dynamics and statistical models used to analyze data. Ecologists routinely conduct experiments where the data from each replicate are short time series of estimated population abundances structured by stage, species, and/or other information, and the conventional test for treatment effects uses a general linear model (GLM) such as analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, GLMs do not incorporate demographic relationships between abundances through time. An alternative is to use population-dynamics models as frameworks for statistical hypothesis testing. This approach requires general methods for-fitting structured population models that can incorporate both process noise (stochastic dynamics) and observation error (inaccurate data). This paper presents such methods and compares them to GLMs for testing population-dynamics hypotheses from experiments. The methods are Monte Carlo state-space likelihood methods, including a basic Monte Carlo integration method and a recently developed Monte Carlo kernel likelihood method. Three simulated examples of population-dynamics experiments were used to compare analysis with a population model to ANOVA, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and, repeated-measures ANOVA. The examples considered manipulations of host-plant growth conditions, causing decreased survival and increased fecundity; predator addition to investigate a behaviorally mediated change in prey demography; and changed host-plant growth conditions with a more complex model for herbivore dynamics than the one used for analysis. For the first example, a population model gave much, higher statistical power than any of the ANOVA methods and provides greater biological insight. For the second example, ANOVA models are not suited to test for the behavioral effect, but a population model detected it with high statistical power. The third example suggests that even incorrect biological structure can provide better inferences than omitting all biological structure. The likelihood methods presented here make analysis with structured population models feasible for a wide range of models incorporating process noise and observation error, thus offering higher statistical power and greater biological insight for population-dynamics experiments. }

Amino acid replacements could be obtained without regard to their effects on lactase activity by selecting spontaneous mutations that relieved the strong polarity of six nonsense mutations. When streaked on MacConkey-lactose indicator plates, approximately 75\% of these mutants gave strong red lactose-fermenting colonies, and 25\% gave white nonfermenting colonies. Mutants from 11 other nonsense codons were isolated directly using MacConkey-lactose indicator plates, on which positive color indication requires only 0.5\% of the wildtype lactase activity. Among the total of 17 codons, 25 variant beta-galactosidases were identified using electrophoresis and thermal denaturation studies. The fitness effects of these variant beta-galactosidases were determined using competition experiments conducted with lactose as the sole nutrient limiting the growth rate in chemostat cultures. Three of the replacements were deleterious, one was selectively advantageous, and the selective effects of the remaining 21 were undetectable under conditions in which the smallest detectable selection coefficient was approximately 0.4\%/generation.},

  Abstract                 = {High throughput methods for detecting protein interactions require assessment of their accuracy. We present two forms of computational assessment. The first method is the expression profile reliability (EPR) index. The EPR index estimates the biologically relevant fraction of protein interactions detected in a high throughput screen. It does so by comparing the RNA expression profiles for the proteins whose interactions are found in the screen with expression profiles for known interacting and non-interacting pairs of proteins. the second form of assessment is the paralogous verification method (PVM). This method judges an interaction likely if the putatively interacting pair has paralogs that also interact. In contrast to the EPR index, which evaluates datasets of interactions, PVM scores individual interactions. On a test set, PVM identifies correctly 40PERCENT of true interactions with a false positive rate of similar to 1PERCENT. EPR and PVM were applied to the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP), a large and diverse collection of protein-protein interactions that contains over 8000 \emph{{S}accharomyces cerevisiae} pairwise protein interactions. Using these two methods, we estimate that similar to50PERCENT of them are reliable, and with the aid of PVM we identify confidently 3003 of them.

Recently, however, a more than transient link between the coding genetic sequence and the protein structure has become apparent. The two interact at the ribosome via the process of co-translational protein folding. Evidence for co-translational folding is growing rapidly, but the influence of codons on the protein structure attained is still highly contentious. It is theorised that the speed of codon translation modulates the time available for protein folding and hence the protein structure.

In this Perspective, we present a model for a new network that regulates the cellular response to xenobiotic exposures and other stresses in which stress-induced reprogramming of a system of dozens of post-transcriptional modifications on tRNA (tRNA) promotes selective translation of codon-biased mRNAs for critical response proteins. As a product of novel genomic and bioanalytical technologies, this model has strong parallels with the regulatory networks of DNA methylation in epigenetics and the variety of protein secondary modifications comprising signaling pathways and the histone code. When present at the tRNA wobble position, the modified ribonucleosides enhance the translation of mRNAs in which the cognate codons of the tRNAs are highly over-represented and that represent critical stress response proteins. A parallel system may also downregulate the translation of families of proteins. Notably, dysregulation of the tRNA methyltransferase enzymes in humans has also been implicated in cancer etiology, with demonstrated oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Pioneer crystallographic studies of the isolated 30S ribosomal subunit provided the first structural insights into the decoding process. Recently, new crystallographic data on full 70S ribosomes with mRNA and tRNAs have shown that the formation of the tight decoding centre is ensured by conformational rearrangement of the 30S subunit (domain closure), which is identical for cognate or near-cognate tRNA. When a GU forms at the first or second codon-anticodon positions (near-cognate tRNA), the ribosomal decoding centre forces the adoption of Watson-Crick GC-like geometry rather than that of the expected Watson-Crick wobble pair. Energy expenditure for rarely occuring tautomeric base required for Watson-Crick GC-like GU pair or the repulsion energy due to steric clash within the mismatched base pair could constitute the only cause for efficient rejection of a near-cognate tRNA. Our data suggest that "geometrical mimicry" can explain how wrong aminoacyl-tRNAs with GU pairs in the codon-anticodon helix forming base pairs with Watson-Crick geometry in the decoding center can be incorporated into the polypeptide chain.

Drosophila melanogaster males (but not females) perform an elaborate and innate courtship ritual directed toward females (but not males). Male courtship requires products of the fruitless (fru) gene, which is spliced differently in males and females. We have generated alleles of fru that are constitutively spliced in either the male or the female mode. We show that male splicing is essential for male courtship behavior and sexual orientation. More importantly, male splicing is also sufficient to generate male behavior in otherwise normal females. These females direct their courtship toward other females (or males engineered to produce female pheromones). The splicing of a single neuronal gene thus specifies essentially all aspects of a complex innate behavior.},

Indeed, several metrics now suggest that rates of gene birth and death per gene are only 10-40\% lower than nucleotide substitutions per site, and that per nucleotide, the consequent lineage-specific expansion and contraction of gene families may play at least as large a role in adaptation as changes in orthologous sequences. While gene family evolution is pervasive, it may be especially important in our own evolution since it appears that the "revolving door" of gene duplication and loss has undergone multiple accelerations in the lineage leading to humans. In this paper, we review current understanding of gene family evolution including: methods for inferring copy number change, evidence for adaptive expansion and adaptive contraction of gene families, the origins of new families and deaths of previously established ones, and finally we conclude with a perspective on challenges and promising directions for future research.},

The model, a stochastic version of the Gompertz model, can be transformed into a linear Gaussian state-space model (Kalman filter) for convenient fitting to time series data. The model has a multivariate normal likelihood function and is simple enough for a variety of uses ranging from theoretical study of parameter estimation issues to routine data analyses in population monitoring. A special case of the model is the discrete-time, stochastic exponential growth model (density independence) with environmental-type process error and lognormal observation error. We describe two methods for estimating parameters in the Gompertz state-space model, and we compare the statistical qualities of the methods with computer simulations. The methods are maximum likelihood based on observations and restricted maximum likelihood based on first differences. Both offer adequate statistical properties. Because the likelihood function is identical to a repeated-measures analysis of variance model with a random time effect, parameter estimates can be calculated using PROC MIXED of SAS. We use the model to analyze a data set from the Breeding Bird Survey. The fitted model suggests that over 70\% of the noise in the population's growth rate is due to observation error. The model describes the autocovariance properties of the data especially well. While observation error and process noise variance parameters can both be estimated from one time series, multimodal likelihood functions can and do occur. For data arising from the model, the statistically consistent parameter estimates do not necessarily correspond to the global maximum in the likelihood function. Maximization, simulation, and bootstrapping programs must accommodate the phenomenon of multimodal likelihood functions to produce statistically valid results.},

We analyzed spontaneous mutation processes across multiple genomic regions using two sets of mismatch repair-deficient (msh-2 and msh-6) Caenorhabditis elegans mutation-accumulation (MA) lines and compared our observations to mutation spectra in a set of wild-type (WT), repair-proficient C. elegans MA lines. Across most sequences surveyed in the MMR-deficient MA lines, mutation rates were similar to 100-fold higher than rates in the WT MA lines, although homopolymeric nucleotide-run (HP) loci composed of A:T base pairs mutated at an similar to 500-fold greater rate. In contrast to yeast and humans where mutation spectra vary substantially with respect to different specific MMR-deficient genotypes, mutation rates and patterns were overall highly similar between the msh-2 and msh-6 C. elegans MA lines. This, along with the apparent absence of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH3 ortholog in the C. elegans genome, suggests that C. elegans MMR surveillance is carried out by a single Msh-2/Msh-6 heterodimer.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary theories of morality, beginning with Darwin, have focused on explanations for altruism. More generally, these accounts have concentrated on conscience (self-regulatory mechanisms) to the neglect of condemnation (mechanisms for punishing others). As a result, few theoretical tools are available for understanding the rapidly accumulating data surrounding third-party judgment and punishment. Here we consider the strategic interactions among actors, victims, and third-parties to help illuminate condemnation. We argue that basic differences between the adaptive problems faced by actors and third-parties indicate that actor conscience and third-party condemnation are likely performed by different cognitive mechanisms. Further, we argue that current theories of conscience do not easily explain its experimentally demonstrated insensitivity to consequences. However, these results might be explicable if conscience functions, in part, as a defense system for avoiding third-party punishment. If conscience serves defensive functions, then its computational structure should be closely tailored to the details of condemnation mechanisms. This possibility underscores the need for a better understanding of condemnation, which is important not only in itself but also for explaining the nature of conscience. We outline three evolutionary mysteries of condemnation that require further attention: third-party judgment, moralistic punishment, and moral impartiality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Thus a random recursive tree is produced over the natural numbers. If (quasi) scale invariance is assumed, the length distribution in a single history tends to a log-normal form with a specific signature of the deviations from exact Gaussianity.

Our set of 261 sporulation-deficient genes illustrates the importance of autophagy, carbon utilization, and transcriptional machinery during sporulation. These general cellular factors are more likely to exhibit fitness defects when deleted and less likely to be transcriptionally regulated than sporulation-specific genes. Our postgermination screening assay identified recombination/chromosome segregation genes, aneuploid strains, and possible germination-specific factors. Finally, our results facilitate a genome-wide comparison of expression pattern and mutant phenotype for a developmental process and suggest that 16\% of genes differentially expressed during sporulation confer altered efficiency of spore production or defective postgermination growth when disrupted. },

Patch models that incorporate the spatial structure of the landscape have been used to investigate static habitat destruction by comparing persistence results within nested landscapes. Other researchers have incorporated temporal structure into their models by making habitat suitability a dynamic feature of the landscape. In this article, we present a spatially realistic patch model that allows patches to be in one of three states: uninhabitable, habitable, or occupied. The model is analytically tractable and allows us to explore the interactions between the spatial and temporal structure of the landscape as perceived by the target species. Extinction thresholds are derived that depend on habitat suitability, mean lifetime of a patch, and metapopulation capacity. We find that a species is able to tolerate more ephemeral destruction, provided that the rate of the destruction does not exceed the scale of its own metapopulation dynamics, which is dictated by natural history characteristics and the spatial structure of the landscape. This model allows for an expansion of the classic definition of a patch and should prove useful when considering species inhabiting complex dynamic landscapes, for example, agricultural landscapes.},

Consequently, such sequences are subject to rapid evolutionary change. By examining the Troponin C gene family of Drosophila melanogaster, which has euchromatic and heterochromatic members, we find that protein-coding genes also evolve in response to their chromosomal location. The heterochromatic members of the family show a reduced CG content and increased variation in DNA sequence. We show that the CG reduction applies broadly to the protein-coding sequences of genes located at the heterochromatin:euchromatin interface, with a very strong correlation between CG content and the distance from centric heterochromatin. We also observe a similar trend in the transition from telomeric heterochromatin to euchromatin. We propose that the methylation of DNA is one of the forces driving this sequence evolution. },

  Abstract                 = {The term quorum sensing (QS) is used to describe the communication between bacterial cells, whereby a coordinated population response is controlled by diffusible molecules produced by individuals. QS has not only been described between cells of the same species (intraspecies), but also between species (interspecies) and between bacteria and higher organisms (inter-kingdom). The fact that QS-based communication appears to be widespread among microbes is strange, considering that explaining both cooperation and communication are two of the greatest problems in evolutionary biology. From an evolutionary perspective, intraspecies signalling can be explained using models such as kin selection, but when communication is described between species, it is more difficult to explain. It is probable that in many cases this involves QS molecules being used as 'cues’ by other species as a guide to future action or as manipulating molecules whereby one species will 'coerce’ a response from another. In these cases, the usage of QS molecules cannot be described as signalling. This review seeks to integrate the evolutionary literature on animal signalling with the microbiological literature on QS, and asks whether QS within bacteria is true signalling or whether these molecules are also used as cues or for the coercion of other cells.},

This model, a generalization of previously developed evolutionary models, has several distinguishing characteristics: it separately accounts for the processes of mutation and substitution, allows for heterogeneity among substitution rates and among evolutionary constraints, and does not make any prior assumptions about which sites or characteristics of proteins are important to molecular evolution. While the model has fewer adjustable parameters than the general reversible mtREV model, when optimized it outperforms mtREV in likelihood analysis on protein-coding mitochondrial genes. In addition, the optimized fitness parameters of the model show correspondence to some biophysical characteristics of amino acids. }

  Abstract                 = {Mutants of \emph{Escherichia coli} partially deficient in peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase are killed by the expression of certain very short open reading frames (mini-genes), encoded by the wild-type bar regions of phage lambda. According to the current hypothesis, protein synthesis is shut off, and the host cells die, after essential {tRNA} species become sequestered due to abnormal translation termination (drop-off) of mini-gene-encoded peptides as peptidyl-{tRNA}. Here we study variants of bar mini-genes, both \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro}, in order to identify the structural elements that influence this inhibition of protein synthesis. Three parameters were measured during the expression of these variants: the rates of normal translation termination, peptidyl-{tRNA} dissociation from the ribosome and hydrolysis of peptidyl-{tRNA} by peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase were measured. Previous observations that RRF, EFG and RF3 stimulated drop-off were confirmed and extended; stimulation by these factors can reach 30-fold. Both factor-stimulated and spontaneous drop-off depended on the nature of the stop signal. The degree of inhibition of cell growth following induction of mini-gene expression could be accounted for in terms of a toxicity index comprising the three parameters above. Inhibition was greatly reduced in cells lacking RF3. Mini-genes with more efficient Shine/Dalgarno sequences killed cells even with normal peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase activity. It is proposed that the retranslation by ribosomes of mini-gene transcripts with efficient ribosome binding (Shine/Dalgarno) sequences strongly contributes to the inhibitory effects of mini-gene expression on protein synthesis.

Unfortunately, one of these conditions is difficult to verify in practice. Here we present an alternative regularity condition that is straightforwardly verifiable. An application to the backcalculation estimates of AIDS incidence is presented. Explicit formulae are given for the asymptotic variances and covariances of the backcalculation estimators. The associated confidence interval for the size of the HIV infected population is comparable to the likelihood-ratio-test-based interval given in Brookmeyer \& Gall (1988). A simulation study shows that the asymptotic normal interval is highly accurate in terms of coverage probability.},

The concentration of an isoacceptor and its charged fraction are principal determinants of the translation rate of its codons. A recent theoretical model predicts that amino-acid starvation results in 'selective charging' where the charging levels of some tRNA isoacceptors will be low and those of others will remain high. Here, we developed a microarray for the analysis of charged fractions of tRNAs and measured charging for all Escherichia coli tRNAs before and during leucine, threonine or arginine starvation. Before starvation, most tRNAs were fully charged. During starvation, the isoacceptors in the leucine, threonine or arginine families showed selective charging when cells were starved for their cognate amino acid, directly confirming the theoretical prediction. Codons read by isoacceptors that retain high charging can be used for efficient translation of genes that are essential during amino-acid starvation. Selective charging can explain anomalous patterns of codon usage in the genes for different families of proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {Nearly 200 million individuals worldwide are currently infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV)(1). Combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, the latest treatment for HCV infection, elicits long-term responses in only about 50\% of patients treated(2-4). No effective alternative treatments exist for non-responders(5). Consequently, significant efforts are continuing to maximize response to combination therapy(6,7). However, rational therapy optimization is precluded by the poor understanding of the mechanism(s) of ribavirin action against HCV8. Ribavirin alone induces either a transient early decline or no decrease in HCV viral load(9-12), but in combination with interferon it significantly improves long-term response rates(2-4,13-15). Here we present a model of HCV dynamics in which, on the basis of growing evidence(16-21), we assume that ribavirin decreases HCV infectivity in an infected individual in a dose-dependent manner. The model quantitatively predicts long-term response rates to interferon monotherapy and combination therapy, fits observed patterns of HCV RNA decline in patients undergoing therapy, reconciles conflicting observations of the influence of ribavirin on HCV RNA decline, provides key insights into the mechanism of ribavirin action against HCV, and establishes a framework for rational therapy optimization. }

  Abstract                 = {Objective To provide principles for the appropriate use of avermectin/milbemycin or macrocyclic lactone (ML) anthelmintics in sheep, to ensure effective worm control and to minimise selection for ML resistance. Strategy The principles were based on an assessment of the information currently available. The MLs were categorised into three groups (ivermectin [IVM], abamectin [ABA] and moxidectin [MOX]) based on structural differences, persistence and efficacy against ML resistant strains. The reported order of activity or efficacy against ML resistant worm strains was IVM<ABA<MOX. General treatment schemes were considered for Australian conditions and were divided into the following situations: 1. quarantine treatment, 2. treatment on/to clean pasture, 3. treatment on/to safe pasture, 4. treatment on/to moderate/heavily contaminated pasture. For each of these situations a strategy was considered for farms where ML resistance was present or absent. It was assumed that resistance commonly occurs in some or all other broad spectrum anthelmintics, and even where ML resistance has been detected, the ML group remains the most effective. The guidelines provided are general and it is expected that state agencies and sheep/veterinary advisers would give specific advice to suit their environments and drug resistance/worm problems. Conclusions The primary recommendation is to use a mixture of effective drugs when treating sheep. However, unless the combination treatment is highly effective it is unlikely to delay selection for ML resistance if sheep are being treated and moved to a clean or safe pasture. Where possible, reliance on the ML anthelmintics should be reduced by not using them every year, not using them in low risk stock or by using narrow spectrum and low efficacy drugs such as naphthalophos when appropriate. Anthelmintic treatment should be given as part of a strategic worm control program. It is suggested that IVM-oral and IVM-capsules should not be used when ML resistance is present. In this situation MOX or ABA should be used in combination with other drugs, provided that the chosen MIL is effective against the resistant parasite. It is essential to monitor the efficacy of ML and drug combinations by post-treatment worm egg counts, particularly when ML resistance has been detected. }

  Abstract                 = {Intracellular proteins are targeted for degradation by the covalent attachment of chains of the small protein ubiquitin; a process known as ubiquitylation. Many proteins are phosphorylated prior to ubiquitylation, and therefore ubiquitylation and degradation of these proteins is regulated by kinase activity and signalling cascades. Many ubiquitylated proteins are degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex, which is found in the cytosol and nucleus. The 26 S proteasome consists of a 20 S core with proteolytic activity and 18 S regulatory complexes containing ATPases and ubiquitin-chain-binding proteins. Proteins degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway include cyclins and other regulators of the cell cycle, and transcription factors. Abnormal polypeptides are also degraded by the ubiquitin pathway, including abnormal polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum, which are translocated back out of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to ubiquitylation and degradation by the proteasome. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is implicated in numerous diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.}

Whilst this can be achieved in single-cell culture using stable isotope precursors, it is more challenging to develop methods for intact animals. In this study, we show how dietary administration of stable isotope-labelled amino acids can obtain information on the relative rates of synthesis and degradation of individual proteins in a proteome. The pattern of stable isotope-labelling in tryptic peptides can be deconstructed to yield a highly reliable measure of the isotope abundance of the precursor pool, a parameter that is often difficult to acquire. We demonstrate this approach using chickens fed a semisynthetic diet containing [H-2(8)]valine at a calculated relative isotope abundance (RIA) of 0.5. When the labelling pattern of gel-resolved muscle proteins was analyzed, the intracellular precursor isotope abundance was 0.35, consistent with dilution of the amino acid precursor pool with unlabelled amino acids derived from degradation of pre-existing proteins. However, the RIA was stable over an extended labelling window, and permitted calculation of the rates of synthesis and degradation of individual proteins isolated by gel electrophoresis. For the first time, it is feasible to contemplate the analysis of turnover of individual proteins in intact animals. }

In our assay the estimation of processivity was made from a system in which transcription is dependent on T7 RNA polymerase in order to eliminate the influence of transcriptional polarity on our measurements. We found that the processivity of translation is reciprocally correlated to the degree with which mutant ribosomes restrict nonsense suppression events. This is observed when transcription is from both T7 RNA polymerase and \emph{{E}scherichia coli} RNA polymerase. In other words, we have confirmed the expected correlation between increased accuracy of {tRNA} selection and decreased processivity of translation. No such monotonic correlation was obtained with ribosome ambiguity (ram) mutants, though all of these were less processive than wild-type ribosomes. In addition, streptomycin was found to simultaneously stimulate {tRNA} selection errors and processivity of translation for a mutant that is partially dependent on streptomycin. These data suggest that the growth rates of ribosome mutants are significantly decreased by the degree to which their processivity in translation is affected. Furthermore, we suggest that streptomycin dependence is a phenomenon reflecting the interplay of the restrictive mutation and antibiotic on the processivity of translation.}

  Abstract                 = {Schizophrenia is one of the most detrimental common psychiatric disorders, occurring at a prevalence of approximately 1\%, and characterized by increased mortality and reduced reproduction, especially in men. The heritability has been estimated around 70\% and the genome-wide association meta-analyses conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium have been successful at identifying an increasing number of risk loci. Various theories have been proposed to explain why genetic variants that predispose to schizophrenia persist in the population, despite the fitness reduction in affected individuals, a question known as the evolutionary paradox. In this review, we consider evolutionary perspectives of schizophrenia and of the empirical evidence that may support these perspectives. Proposed evolutionary explanations include balancing selection, fitness trade-offs, fluctuating environments, sexual selection, mutation-selection balance and genomic conflicts. We address the expectations about the genetic architecture of schizophrenia that are predicted by different evolutionary scenarios and discuss the implications for genetic studies. Several potential sources of missing heritability, including geneenvironment interactions, epigenetic variation, and rare genetic variation are examined from an evolutionary perspective. A better understanding of evolutionary history may provide valuable clues to the genetic architecture of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, which is highly relevant to genetic studies that aim to detect genetic risk variants.

  Abstract                 = {The abundance and identity of functional variation segregating in natural populations is paramount to dissecting the molecular basis of quantitative traits as well as human genetic diseases. Genome sequencing of multiple organisms of the same species provides an efficient means of cataloging rearrangements, insertion, or deletion polymorphisms (InDels) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs). While inbreeding depression and heterosis imply that a substantial amount of polymorphism is deleterious, distinguishing deleterious from neutral polymorphism remains a significant challenge. To identify deleterious and neutral DNA sequence variation within Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we sequenced the genome of a vineyard and oak tree strain and compared them to a reference genome. Among these three strains, 6\% of the genome is variable, mostly attributable to variation in genome content that results from large InDels. Out of the 88,000 polymorphisms identified, 93\% are SNPs and a small but significant fraction can be attributed to recent interspecific introgression and ectopic gene conversion. In comparison to the reference genome, there is substantial evidence for functional variation in gene content and structure that results from large InDels, frame-shifts, and polymorphic start and stop codons. Comparison of polymorphism to divergence reveals scant evidence for positive selection but an abundance of evidence for deleterious SNPs. We estimate that 12\% of coding and 7\% of noncoding SNPs are deleterious. Based on divergence among 11 yeast species, we identified 1,666 nonsynonymous SNPs that disrupt conserved amino acids and 1,863 noncoding SNPs that disrupt conserved noncoding motifs. The deleterious coding SNPs include those known to affect quantitative traits, and a subset of the deleterious noncoding SNPs occurs in the promoters of genes that show allele-specific expression, implying that some cis-regulatory SNPs are deleterious. Our results show that the genome sequences of both closely and distantly related species provide a means of identifying deleterious polymorphisms that disrupt functionally conserved coding and noncoding sequences. },

Here, I review older arguments for junk grounded in the C-value paradox and propose a thought experiment to challenge ENCODE~s ontology. Specifically, what would we expect for the number of functional elements (as ENCODE defines them) in genomes much larger than our own genome? If the number were to stay more or less constant, it would seem sensible to consider the rest of the DNA of larger genomes to be junk or, at least, assign it a different sort of role (structural rather than informational). If, however, the number of functional elements were to rise significantly with C-value then, (i) organisms with genomes larger than our genome are more complex phenotypically than we are, (ii) ENCODE~s definition of functional element identifies many sites that would not be considered functional or phenotype-determining by standard uses in biology, or (iii) the same phenotypic functions are often determined in a more diffuse fashion in larger-genomed organisms. Good cases can be made for propositions ii and iii. A larger theoretical framework, embracing informational and structural roles for DNA, neutral as well as adaptive causes of complexity, and selection as a multilevel phenomenon, is needed.},

  Abstract                 = {Robustness seems to be the opposite of evolvability. If phenotypes are robust against mutation, we might expect that a population will have difficulty adapting to an environmental change, as several studies have suggested. However, other studies contend that robust organisms are more adaptable. A quantitative understanding of the relationship between robustness and evolvability will help resolve these conflicting reports and will clarify outstanding problems in molecular and experimental evolution, evolutionary developmental biology and protein engineering. Here we demonstrate, using a general population genetics model, that mutational robustness can either impede or facilitate adaptation, depending on the population size, the mutation rate and the structure of the fitness landscape. In particular, neutral diversity in a robust population can accelerate adaptation as long as the number of phenotypes accessible to an individual by mutation is smaller than the total number of phenotypes in the fitness landscape. These results provide a quantitative resolution to a significant ambiguity in evolutionary theory.},

In S. cerevisiae, introducing Dicer and Argonaute of S. castellii restores RNAi, and the reconstituted pathway silences endogenous retrotransposons.

  Abstract                 = {Gene arrays demonstrate a promising ability to characterize expression levels across the entire genome but suffer from significant levels of measurement noise. We present a rigorous new approach to estimate transcript levels and ratios from one or more gene array experiments, given a model of measurement noise and available prior information. The Bayesian estimation of array measurements (BEAM) technique provides a principled method to identify changes in expression level, combine repeated measurements, or deal with negative expression level measurements. BEAM is more flexible than existing techniques, because it does not assume a specific functional form for noise and prior models. Instead, it relies on computational techniques that apply to a broad range of models. We use Affymetrix yeast chip data to illustrate the process of developing accurate noise and prior models from existing experimental data. The resulting noise model includes novel features such as heavy-tailed additive noise and a gene-specific bias term. We also verify that the resulting noise and prior models fit data from an Affymetrix human chip set. },

The best predictor of evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained unexplained. Here, we hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.},

Here, we carry out the first combined analysis of seven predictors (gene expression level, dispensability, protein abundance, codon adaptation index, gene length, number of protein-protein interactions, and the gene's centrality in the interaction network) previously reported to have independent influences on protein evolutionary rates. Strikingly, our analysis reveals a single dominant variable linked to the number of translation events which explains 40-fold more variation in evolutionary rate than any other, suggesting that protein evolutionary rate has a single major determinant among the seven predictors. The dominant variable explains nearly half the variation in the rate of synonymous and protein evolution. We show that the two most commonly used methods to disentangle the determinants of evolutionary rate, partial correlation analysis and ordinary multivariate regression, produce misleading or spurious results when applied to noisy biological data. We overcome these difficulties by employing principal component regression, a multivariate regression of evolutionary rate against the principal components of the predictor variables. Our results support the hypothesis that translational selection governs the rate of synonymous and protein sequence evolution in yeast.},

In metazoans, these trends are strongest in tissues composed of neurons, whose structure and lifetime confer extreme sensitivity to protein misfolding. We propose, and demonstrate using a molecular-level evolutionary simulation, that selection against toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create all of the observed covariation. The mechanistic model of molecular evolution that emerges yields testable biochemical predictions, calls into question the use of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios (Ka/Ks) to detect functional selection, and suggests how mistranslation may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.},

Because a strong synonymous codon usage bias in the human DRD2 gene, suggesting selection on synonymous positions, was revealed by the relative independence of the G+C content of the third codon positions from the isochoric G+C frequencies, we chose to investigate functional effects of the six known naturally occurring synonymous changes (C132T, G423A, T765C, C939T, C957T, and G1101A) in the human DRD2. We report here that some synonymous mutations in the human DRD2 have functional effects and suggest a novel genetic mechanism. 957T, rather than being silent', altered the predicted {mRNA} folding, led to a decrease in {mRNA} stability and translation, and dramatically changed dopamine-induced up-regulation of DRD2 expression. 1101A did not show an effect by itself but annulled the above effects of 957T in the compound clone 957T/1101A, demonstrating that combinations of synonymous mutations can have functional consequences drastically different from those of each isolated mutation. C957T was found to be in linkage disequilibrium in a European-American population with the -141C Ins/Del and TaqI A' variants, which have been reported to be associated with schizophrenia and alcoholism, respectively. These results call into question some assumptions made about synonymous variation in molecular population genetics and gene-mapping studies of diseases with complex inheritance, and indicate that synonymous variation can have effects of potential pathophysiological and pharmacogenetic importance.},

First, instead of cohybridizing labeled experimental and control samples, we hybridize each sample against labeled oligos complementary to every microarray feature. Ratios between sample intensities and intensities of the oligo reference measure sample RNA levels on a scale that relates to their absolute abundance, instead of to the variable and unknown abundances of a cDNA reference. We demonstrate that results from this type of hybridization are accurate and retain absolute abundance information far better than conventional microarray ratios. Next, to ensure the accurate measurement of sample and oligo reference intensities, which may differ by several orders of magnitude, we use a linear regression algorithm, implemented in a freely available PERIL script, to combine the linear ranges of multiple scans taken at different scanner sensitivity settings onto an extended linear scale. We discuss future applications of our method to measure RNA expression on the absolute scale of number of transcripts per cell from any organism for which oligo-based spotted-glass microarrays are available. },

  Abstract                 = {Identifying the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution by comparative genomics is often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. The hemiascomycete yeasts, with their compact genomes, similar lifestyle and distinct sexual and physiological properties, provide a unique opportunity to explore such mechanisms. We present here the complete, assembled genome sequences of four yeast species, selected to represent a broad evolutionary range within a single eukaryotic phylum, that after analysis proved to be molecularly as diverse as the entire phylum of chordates. A total of approximately 24,200 novel genes were identified, the translation products of which were classified together with Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins into about 4,700 families, forming the basis for interspecific comparisons. Analysis of chromosome maps and genome redundancies reveal that the different yeast lineages have evolved through a marked interplay between several distinct molecular mechanisms, including tandem gene repeat formation, segmental duplication, a massive genome duplication and extensive gene loss. },

These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome rearrangements, especially amplifications and deletions, have regularly been observed as responses to sustained application of the same strong selective pressure in microbial populations growing in continuous culture. We studied eight strains of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) isolated after 100-500 generations of growth in glucose-limited chemostats. Changes in DNA copy number were assessed at single-gene resolution by using DNA microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. Six of these evolved strains were aneuploid as the result of gross chromosomal rearrangements. Most of the aneuploid regions were the result of translocations, including three instances of a shared breakpoint on chromosome 14 immediately adjacent to CIT1, which encodes the citrate synthase that performs a key regulated step in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Three strains had amplifications in a region of chromosome 4 that includes the high-affinity hexose transporters; one of these also had the aforementioned chromosome 14 break. Three strains had extensive overlapping deletions of the right arm of chromosome 15. Further analysis showed that each of these genome rearrangements was bounded by transposon-related sequences at the breakpoints. The observation of repeated, independent, but nevertheless very similar, chromosomal rearrangements in response to persistent selection of growing cells parallels the genome rearrangements that characteristically accompany tumor progression. }

In those three species, we observed a clear correlation between codon usage and gene expression levels and showed that this correlation is not due to a mutational bias. This provides direct evidence for selection on silent sites in those three distantly related multicellular eukaryotes. Surprisingly, there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage and protein length. This effect is not due to a smaller size of highly expressed proteins. Thus, for a same-expression pattern, the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. This puzzling observation is not predicted by any of the current models of selection on codon usage and thus raises the question of how translation efficiency affects fitness in multicellular organisms. },

Models have been reconstructed for almost 20 bacterial species, so far mainly through expert curation efforts integrating information from the literature with genome annotation. A wide variety of computational methods exploiting metabolic models have been developed and applied to bacteria, yielding valuable insights into bacterial metabolism and evolution, and providing a sound basis for computer-assisted design in metabolic engineering. Recent advances in computational systems biology and high-throughput experimental technologies pave the way for the systematic reconstruction of metabolic models from genomes of new species, and a corresponding expansion of the scope of their applications. In this review, we provide an introduction to the key ideas of metabolic modeling, survey the methods, and resources that enable model reconstruction and refinement, and chart applications to the investigation of global properties of metabolic systems, the interpretation of experimental results, and the re-engineering of their biochemical capabilities. },

The structure of the T cell-DC immunological synapse departs from the canonical structure formed with B cells or with supported planar bilayers in that it has multiple foci of T-cell receptor interactions rather than a central focus. Recent studies on model systems provide insight into the mechanisms and biological consequences of the unique T cell-DC synaptic patterns.},

  Abstract                 = { in theory, parasites can create time-lagged, frequenc dependent selection in their hosts, resulting in oscillatory gene-frequency dynamics in both the host and the parasite (the Red Queen hypothesis). However, oscillatory dynamics have not been observed in natural populations. In the present study, we evaluated the dynamics of asexual clones of a New Zealand snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, and its trematode parasites over a five-year period. During the summer of each year, we determined host-clone frequencies in random samples of the snail to track genetic changes in the snail population. Similarly, we monitored changes in the parasite population, focusing on the dominant parasite, Microphallus sp., by calculating the frequency of clones in samples of infected individuals from the same collections. We then compared these results to the results of a computer model that was designed to examine clone frequency dynamics for various levels of parasite virulence. Consistent with these simulations and with ideas regarding dynamic coevolution, parasites responded to common clones in a time-lagged fashion. Finally, in a laboratory experiment, we found that crones that had been rare during the previous five years were significantly less infectible by Microphallus when compared to the common clones. Taken together, these results confirm that rare host genotypes are more likely to escape infection by parasites; they also show that host-parasite interactions produce, in a natural population, some of the dynamics anticipated by the Red Queen hypothesis. },

  Abstract                 = {Genome-wide studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae concluded that the dominant determinant of protein evolutionary rates is expression level: highly expressed proteins generally evolve~most slowly. To determine how this constraint affects the evolution of protein interactions, we directly measure evolutionary rates of protein interface, surface, and core residues by structurally mapping domain interactions to yeast genomes. We find that {mRNA} level and protein abundance, though correlated, report on pressures affecting regions of proteins differently. Pressures proportional to {mRNA} level slow evolutionary rates of all structural regions and reduce the variability in rate differences between interfaces and other surfaces. In contrast, the evolutionary rate variation within a~domain is much less correlated to protein abundance. Distinct pressures may be associated primarily with the cost ({mRNA} level) and functional (protein abundance) benefit of protein production. Interfaces of proteins with low {mRNA} levels may have higher evolutionary flexibility and could constitute the raw material for new functions.}

  Abstract                 = {In this review, I discuss the evidence for differential natural selection acting across enzymes in the glycolytic pathway in Drosophila. Across the genome, genes evolve at very different rates and possess markedly varying levels of molecular polymorphism, codon bias and expression variation. Discovering the underlying causes of this variation has been a challenge in evolutionary biology. It has been proposed that both the intrinsic properties of enzymes and their pathway position have direct effects on their molecular evolution, and with the genomic era the study of adaptation has been taken to the level of pathways and networks of genes and their products. Of special interest have been the energy-producing pathways. Using both population genetic and experimental approaches, our laboratory has been engaged in a study of molecular variation across the glycolytic pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives. We have observed a pervasive pattern in which genes at the top of the pathway, especially around the intersection at glucose 6-phosphate, show evidence for both contemporary selection, in the form of latitudinal allele clines, and inter-specific selection, in the form of elevated levels of amino acid substitutions between species. To further explore this question, future work will require corroboration in other species, expansion into tangential pathways, and experimental work to better characterize metabolic control through the pathway and to examine the pleiotropic effects of these genes on other traits and fitness components.},

The utility of the resulting interaction networks will depend on the reliability of the experimental methods and the coverage of the approaches. Known macromolecular complexes provide a defined and objective set of protein interactions with which to compare biochemical and genetic data for validation. Here, we show that a significant fraction of the protein-protein interactions in genome-wide datasets, as well as many of the individual interactions reported in the literature, are inconsistent with the known 3D structures of three recent complexes (RNA polymerase 11, Arp2/3 and the proteasome). Furthermore, comparison among genome-wide datasets, and between them and a larger (but less well resolved) group of 174 complexes, also shows marked inconsistencies. Finally, individual interaction datasets, being inherently noisy, are best used when integrated together, and we show how simple Bayesian approaches can combine them, significantly decreasing error rate.},

Together with the core components SecYE, prokaryotic translocons also contain auxilliary proteins, such as SecDF. Alignment of bacterial and archaeal SecDF protein sequences reveals the presence of a similar number of homologous regions within each protein, Moreover, the conserved sequence domains in the archaeal proteins are located in similar positions as their bacterial counterparts. When these domains are, however, compared along Bacteria-Archaea lines, a much lower degree of similarity is detected. In Bacteria. SecDF are thought to modulate the membrane association of SecA, the ATPase that provides the driving force for bacterial protein secretion. As no archaeal version of SecA has been detected, the sequence differences reported here may reflect functional differences between bacterial and archaeal SecDF proteins, and by extension, between the bacterial and archaeal protein translocation processes. Moreover, the apparent absence of SecDF in several completed archaeal genomes suggests that differences may exist in the process of protein translocation within the archaeal domain itself.

  Abstract                 = {Genes in the MHC have been associated with mate choice and odor preferences in a variety of animals. Although the role of HLA genes in human mate choice has been controversial, studies in the Hutterites have demonstrated fewer than expected numbers of couples who match for an HLA haplotype, suggesting that in this population there is avoidance of mates with HLA haplotypes similar to one's own haplotype. Recently, 18 olfactory receptor (OR) genes have been mapped to the HLA region, telomeric to the HLA-F locus, providing a potential mechanism for HLA-based odor recognition and perhaps mate preferences in humans. We screened a sample of Hutterites with diverse HLA haplotypes for polymorphisms in the HLA-linked olfactory receptor gene, FAT11, by sequencing, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, and allele-specific oligo dot-blotting. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the single translated exon of this gene, all of which resulted in amino acid substitutions (Phe587Leu, Ala642Val, and Thr1157Ala). The FAT11 Phe587-Val642-Ala1157 allele occurred on 17 different HLA haplotypes, the Leu587-Ala642-Ala1157 allele on 15 haplotypes, the Phe587-Ala642-Ala1157 allele on 16 haplotypes, and the Phe587-Ala642-Thr1157 allele on a single haplotype. Thus, four alleles of the FAT11 gene are present in the Hutterites. This level of variation in the FAT11 gene alone may not be sufficient to contribute to the observed patterns of mate choice in the Hutterites and to individual variation in odor preferences.

Most tRNA modifications were discovered in the 1970s; however, the near-complete description of the genes required to introduce the full set of modifications in both yeast and Escherichia coli is very recent. This led to a new appreciation of the key roles of tRNA modifications and tRNA modification enzymes as checkpoints for tRNA integrity and for integrating translation with other cellular functions such as transcription, primary metabolism, and stress resistance. A global survey of tRNA modification enzymes shows that the functional constraints that drive the presence of modifications are often conserved, but the solutions used to fulfill these constraints differ among different kingdoms, organisms, and species.},

Here we estimate the pattern of phenotypic, environmental, and mutational correlations for a set of life-history, behavioral, and morphological traits using 67 self-fertilizing lines of Caenorhabditis elegans, each having independently experienced an average of 370 generations of spontaneous mutation accumulation. Bivariate relationships of mutational effects indicate the existence of extensive pleiotropy. We find that mutations may tend to produce manifold effects on suites of functionally related traits; however, our data do not support the idea of completely parcelated pleiotropy, in which functional units are separately affected by mutations. Positive net phenotypic and mutational correlations are common for life-history traits, with environmental correlations being comparatively smaller and of the same sign for most pairs of traits. Observed mutational correlations are shown to be higher than those produced by the chance accumulation of nonpleiotropic mutations in the same lines. }

The growing recognition of the molecular mechanisms of pathogen-induced oncogenesis and the difficulty of generating oncogenic mutations without first having large populations of dysregulated cells, however, suggests that pathogens, particularly viruses, are major initiators of oncogenesis for many if not most cancers, and that the traditional mutation-driven process becomes the dominant process after this initiation.

This quality control mechanism is sensitive to perturbations in the codon: anticodon interaction in the P site of the ribosome that trigger a dramatic loss of fidelity in subsequent tRNA and release factor selection events in the A site. These events ultimately lead to premature termination of translation in response to an initial miscoding error. In this work, we extend our investigations of this mechanism to an in vitro reconstituted Saccharomyces cerevisiae translation system. We report that yeast ribosomes do not respond to mismatches in the P site by loss of fidelity in subsequent substrate recognition events. We conclude that retrospective editing, as initially characterized in Escherichia coli, does not occur in S. cerevisiae. These results highlight potential mechanistic differences in the functional core of highly conserved ribosomes.},

It is argued that the positive correlation could be caused by selection to avoid missense errors during translation. Since the cost of producing a protein is proportional to its length, selection in favor of codons which increase accuracy should be greater in longer genes, and long genes should therefore have higher synonymous codon bias. It is also shown that there is variation in synonymous codon use which is independent of either expression level, gene length, amino acid composition, or chromosomal location. This variation is consistent with selection for translational accuracy but may have other origins. }

It is also shown that there is an increase in the frequency of A-ending codons, and a decrease in the frequency of G-ending codons at the end of E. coli genes that lie close to another gene. It is suggested that these trends in composition could be associated with selection against the formation of {mRNA} secondary structure near the start of the next gene on the chromosome. Stop codon use is also affected by the close proximity of genes; many genes are forced to use TGA and TAG stop codons because they terminate either within the Shine-Dalgarno or coding sequence of the next gene on the chromosome. The implications these results have for the evolution of synonymous codon use are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested that mutation bias is the major de terminant of base composition bias at synonymous, intron, and flanking DNA sites in mammals. Here I test this hypothesis using population genetic data from the major histocompatibility genes of several mammalian species. The results of two tests are inconsistent with the mutation hypothesis in coding, noncoding, CpG-island, and non-CpG-island DNA, but are consistent with selection or biased gene conversion. It is argued that biased gene conversion is unlikely to affect silent site base composition in mammals. The results therefore suggest that selection is acting upon silent site G + C content. This may have broad implications, since silent site base composition reflects large-scale variation in G + C content along mammalian chromosomes. The results therefore suggest that selection may be acting upon the base composition of isochores and large sections of junk DNA.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been shown previously that the synonymous substitution rate between \emph{Escherichia coli} and Salmonella typhimurium is lower in highly than in weakly expressed genes, and it has been suggested that this is due to stronger selection for translational efficiency in highly expressed genes as reflected in their greater codon usage bias. This hypothesis is tested here by comparing the substitution rate in codon families with different patterns of synonymous codon use. It is shown that the decline in the substitution rate across expression levels is as great for codon families that do nor appear to be subject to selection for translational efficiency as for those that are. This implies that selection on translational efficiency is not responsible for the decline in the substitution rate across genes. It is argued that the most likely explanation for this decline is a decrease in the mutation rate. It is also shown that a simple evolutionary model in which synonymous codon use is determined by a balance between mutation, selection for an optimal codon, and genetic drift predicts that selection should have little effect on the substitution rate in the present case. }

The rate of synonymous substitution between E.coli and Salmonella typhimurium is substantially reduced near the start of the gene, which suggests the presence of an additional selection pressure which competes with the selection for codons which are most rapidly translated. Possible competing sources of selection are the presence of secondary ribosome binding sites downstream from the start codon, the avoidance of {mRNA} secondary structure near the start of the gene and the use of sub-optimal codons to regulate gene expression. We provide evidence against the last of these possibilities. We also show that there is a decrease in the frequency of A, and an increase in the frequency of G along the E. coli genes at all three codon positions. We argue that these results are most consistent with selection to avoid {mRNA} secondary structure.},

The method is fairly robust to changes in population size and admixture, and it can be corrected for any residual effects if a model of the demography is available. We apply the method to extensively sampled single-nucleotide polymorphism data from humans and estimate the distribution of fitness effects for amino acid changing mutations. We show that a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.23 provides a good fit to the data and we estimate that > 50\% of mutations are likely to have mild effects, such that they reduce fitness by between one one-thousandth and one-tenth. We also infer that < 15\% of new mutations are likely to have strongly deleterious effects. We estimate that on average a nonsynonymous mutation reduces fitness by a few percent and that the average strength of selection acting against a nonsynonymous polymorphism is similar to 9 X 10(-5). We argue that the relaxation of natural selection due to modern medicine and reduced variance in family size is not likely to lead to a rapid decline in genetic quality, but that it will be very difficult to locate most of the genes involved in complex genetic diseases. },

Identical association and dissociation rate constants were observed for all eight aa-{tRNA}s in both the ribosomal A and P sites despite substantial differences in {tRNA} sequence, the type of esterified amino acid, and posttranscriptional modifications. These results indicate that the overall binding of all aa-{tRNA}s to the ribosome is uniform. However, when either the esterified amino acid or the {tRNA} modifications were removed, binding was no longer uniform. These results suggest that differences in {tRNA} sequences and {tRNA} modifications have evolved to offset differential thermodynamic contributions of the esterified amino acid and the codon-anticodon interaction so that ribosomal binding of all aa-{tRNA}s remains uniform. }

  Abstract                 = {Most missense errors have little effect on protein function, since they only exchange one amino acid for another. However, processivity errors, frameshifting or premature termination result in a synthesis of an incomplete peptide. There may be a connection between missense and processivity errors, since processivity errors now appear to result from a second error occurring after recruitment of an errant aminoacyl-tRNA, either spontaneous dissociation causing premature termination or translational frameshifting, This is dearest in programmed translational frameshifting where the mRNA programs errant reading by a near-cognate tRNA; this error promotes a second frameshifting error (a dual-error model of frameshifting). The same mechanism can explain frameshifting by suppressor tRNAs, even those with expanded anticodon loops. The previous model that suppressor tRNAs induce quadruplet translocation now appears incorrect for most, and perhaps for all of them. We suggest that the 'spontaneous' tRNA-induced frameshifting and 'programmed' mRNA-induced frameshifting use the same mechanism, although the frequency of frameshifting is very different. This new model of frameshifting suggests that the tRNA is not acting as the yardstick to measure out the length of the translocation step. Rather, the translocation of 3 nucleotides may be an inherent feature of the ribosome. },

S. paradoxus, the closest known relative of S. cerevisiae, is commonly found on exudates and bark of deciduous trees and in associated soils. This has lead to the idea that S. cerevisiae is a domesticated species, specialized for the fermentation of alcoholic beverages, and isolates of S. cerevisiae from other sources simply represent migrants from these fermentations. We have surveyed DNA sequence diversity at five loci in 81 strains of S. cerevisiae that were isolated from a variety of human and natural fermentations as well as sources unrelated to alcoholic beverage production, such as tree exudates and immunocompromised patients. Diversity within vineyard strains and within sake strains is low, consistent with their status as domesticated stocks. The oldest lineages and the majority of variation are found in strains from sources unrelated to wine production. We propose a model whereby two specialized breeds of S. cerevisiae have been created, one for the production of grape wine and one for the production of sake wine. We estimate that these two breeds have remained isolated from one another for thousands of years, consistent with the earliest archeological evidence for winemaking. We conclude that although there are clearly strains of S. cerevisiae specialized for the production of alcoholic beverages, these have been derived from natural populations unassociated with alcoholic beverage production, rather than the opposite. },

We studied the relative abundance of codons with N-1 contexts in genes from four eukaryotes for which the entire genomes have been sequenced: Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana. For all the studied organisms it was found that 90\% of the codons have a statistically significant N-1 context-dependent codon bias. The relative abundance of each codon with an N-1 context was compared with the relative abundance of the same 4mer oligonucleotide in the whole genome. This comparison showed that in about half of. all cases the context-dependent codon bias could not be explained by the sequence composition of the genome. Ranking statistics were applied to compare context-dependent codon biases for codons from different synonymous groups. We found regularities in N-1 context-dependent codon bias with respect to the codon nucleotide composition. Codons with the same nucleotides in the second and third positions and the same N-1 context have a statistically significant correlation of their relative abundances. },

The neurotropic protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is one of the main candidates and has been associated with various psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. Methods - A narrative review of the literature from the main medical databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO), Google Scholar and Google using combinations of applicable terms. Results - T. gondii affects the brain in both the acute and the latent stages of infection causing apparent brain pathologies in infected rodents and both immuno-compromised and immuno-competent humans. In immuno-competent individuals, behavioural disorders are primarily related to the latent stages of the illness. Behavioural/mental disorders that include schizophrenia, mood disorders, personality changes and cognitive impairments may be related to infection with T gondii. Evidence for a behavioural effect of T gondii comes from observational reports in animal models and controlled behavioural analysis in humans. Indirect clues of infection also come from raised seroprevalence or serotitres of antitoxoplasma antibodies among those with mental disorders. The pathophysiologic mechanism through which T gondii may exert its effect is not clear, but direct impact on the brain and changes in neuroimmunomodulation, neurotransmission and some gene-environment interactions are postulated. Conclusion - There is evidence supporting a potential role of T gondii infection in the onset of some behavioural disorders. Confirmation of such a role would prove a significant breakthrough in the search for the aetiology, treatment and prevention of behavioural disorders, such as schizophrenia. However, the associations remain preliminary. },

This permits characterization of the asymptotic behavior of our distances D-1 and (delta mu)(2) under range constraints. Based on this characterization we develop transformations that partially restore linearity when allele size is restricted. We show that the appropriate transformation cannot be applied in the case of varying mutation rates (beta) and range constraints (R) because of statistical difficulties. In the special case of no variation in beta and R across loci, however, the transformation simplifies to a usable form and results in a distance much more linear with time than distances developed for an infinite range. Although analytically incorrect in the case of variation in beta and R, the simpler transformation is surprisingly insensitive to variation in these parameters, suggesting that it may have considerable utility in phylogenetic studies. },

  Abstract                 = {As methods of molecular phylogeny have become more explicit and more biologically realistic following the pioneering work of Thomas Jukes, they have had to relax their initial assumption that rates of evolution were equal at all sites. Distance matrix and likelihood methods of inferring phylogenies make this assumption; parsimony, when valid, is less limited by it. Nucleotide sequences, including RNA sequences, can show substantial rate variation; protein sequences show rates that vary much more widely. Assuming a prior distribution of rates such as a gamma distribution or lognormal distribution has deservedly been popular, but for likelihood methods it leads to computational difficulties. These can be resolved using hidden Markov model (HMM) methods which approximate the distribution by one with a modest number of discrete rates. Generalized Laguerre quadrature can be used to improve the selection of rates and their probabilities so as to more nearly approach the desired gamma distribution. A model based on population genetics is presented predicting how the rates of evolution might vary from locus to locus. Challenges for the future include allowing rates at a given site to vary along the tree, as in the ``covarion'' model, and allowing them to have correlations that reflect three-dimensional structure, rather than position in the coding sequence. Markov chain Monte Carlo likelihood methods may be the only practical way to carry out computations for these models.},

  Abstract                 = {Hemoglobin A (HbA), the oxygen delivery system in humans, comprises two a and two beta subunits. Free alpha-hemoglobin (alphaHb) is unstable, and its precipitation contributes to the pathophysiology of beta thalassemia. In erythrocytes, the alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) binds aft and inhibits its precipitation. The crystal structure of AHSP bound to Fe(II)-alphaHb reveals that AHSP specifically recognizes the G and H helices of alphaHb through a hydrophobic interface that largely recapitulates the alpha(1)-beta(1) interface of hemoglobin. The AHSP-alphaHb interactions are extensive but suboptimal, explaining why beta-hemoglobin can competitively displace AHSP to form HbA. Remarkably, the Fe(II)-heme group in AHSP bound aft is coordinated by the distal but not the proximal histidine. Importantly, binding to AHSP facilitates the conversion of oxy-alphaHb to a deoxygenated, oxidized [Fe(III)], nonreactive form in which all six coordinate positions are occupied. These observations reveal the molecular mechanisms by which AHSP stabilizes free alphaHb. },

  Abstract                 = {The synthesis of haemoglobin A (HbA) is exquisitely coordinated during erythrocyte development to prevent damaging effects from individual alphaand beta-subunits(1,2). The alpha-haemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP) binds alpha-haemoglobin (alpha Hb), inhibits the ability of alpha Hb to generate reactive oxygen species and prevents its precipitation on exposure to oxidant stress(3-5). The structure of AHSP bound to ferrous alpha Hb is thought to represent a transitional complex through which alpha Hb is converted to a non-reactive, hexacoordinate ferric form(5). Here we report the crystal structure of this ferric alpha Hb - AHSP complex at 2.4 angstrom resolution. Our findings reveal a striking bis-histidyl configuration in which both the proximal and the distal histidines coordinate the haem iron atom. To attain this unusual conformation, segments of alpha Hb undergo drastic structural rearrangements, including the repositioning of several alpha-helices. Moreover, conversion to the ferric bis-histidine configuration strongly and specifically inhibits redox chemistry catalysis and haem loss from alpha Hb. The observed structural changes, which impair the chemical reactivity of haem iron, explain how AHSP stabilizes alpha Hb and prevents its damaging effects in cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Malaria has long been a scourge to humans. The exceptionally high mortality in some regions has led to strong selection for resistance, even at the cost of increased risk of potentially fatal red blood cell deformities in some offspring. In particular, genes that confers resistance to malaria when they appear in heterozygous individuals are known to lead to sickle-cell anemia, or other blood diseases, when they appear in homozygous form. Thus, there is balancing selection against the evolution of resistance, with the strength of that selection dependent upon malaria prevalence. Over longer time scales, the increased frequency of resistance in a population might be expected to decrease the frequency of malaria and reduce selection for resistance. However, possession of the sickle-cell gene leads to longer-lasting parasitaemia in heterozygote individuals, and therefore the presence of resistance may actually increase infection prevalence. In this paper, we explore the interplay among these processes, operating over very different time scales. In particular, we show that on the fast time scale of malarial dynamics, the disease level reaches an equilibrium; on the slower, evolutionary time scale, this equilibrium tracks gene frequency. We analyze the slow time scale dynamics to investigate the impact of malaria on the evolution of resistance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. },

Our results show that the coupled system leads to more complex outcomes than simple patch models which do not include explicit local dynamics. We also discuss implications of the model for ecological systems in fragmented landscapes. }

Transmission occurs via mosquitos which feed on lesions of infected hosts rabbit flea in europe is also an important vector and direct trans. can occur under crowded/close conditions. Australian intro at first seemed to locally die out, but then spread like wildfire spreading out over 1000 miles north-south and also east-west in just three months. Besides field obs. an experimental inoculation was set up and is sketched out. Original virus had 99.8PERCENT host mort, this soon dropped to 90PERCENT within just a few months before/during a second outbreak. Laboratory research on virulence and trans. via mosquitos showed that trans efficiency was related to concentration of virus in skin near lesions. "Researchers found that the virulent and moderately virulent strains were at about the same concentration in the skin, HOwever trans. occurred for only about 4 d. before host death in virul. strain colmpared with 16-25 d for the less virul. strain." Virus Evolution: Trans. of strongly attenuated (i.e. very low vir) strains was impossible or difficult due to the lack of lesion formation or b/c they healed quickly. Ability of virus to make it through overwintering period when trans. is unlikely is also apperently important. (seems like little theoretical studies of this nature have been done) Six virus virulence grades are based on survival time of lab innoculated hosts. Grade I was most virulent, field pops almost immediately evolved to grade III and remained there for more than 30yrs. Host Evolution: Rabbits evolved resistance to Grade I and Grade III in the wild. Similar results found in lab. breeding experiments (i.e. evol. of resist. to grade I.) Additional evidence that the virus has eventually evolved greater virulence levels (i.e. more grade I and II) in regions where there is greater host resistance. }

Despite their importance, however, little theoretical work has considered how evolution may shape the behaviour of these stages. Here, we develop what we believe to be the first stochastic dynamic programming model of parasite life-history strategies to investigate how a trade-off between resource depletion and host encounter rate may shape the optimal infection strategy of a macroparasite. The optimal strategy depends strongly on the probability of host contact and, depending on the relative costs and benefits, macroparasites should adopt either a passive 'ambushing' (sit-and-wait) strategy, an active cruising strategy or a mixed strategy with an initial cruising phase, followed by a switch to ambushing when energy reserves fall to a threshold level. Under no circumstances does the model predict ambush-then-cruise. We use our model to help interpret previously published data on entompathogenic nematode foraging behaviour, showing how this framework could facilitate our understanding of macroparasite behaviour during this key stage of the life-cycle.

Beginning,vith a clonal, founding population, independently evolved strains were obtained from three independent cultures after continuous aerobic growth in glucose-limited chemostats for more than 250 generations. DNA microarrays were used to compare genome-wide patterns of gene expression in the evolved strains and the parental strain. Several hundred genes were found to have significantly altered expression in the evolved strains, Many of these genes showed similar alterations in their expression in all three evolved strains, Genes with altered expression in the three evolved strains included genes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolite transport. These results are consistent with physiological observations and indicate that increased fitness is acquired by altering regulation of central metabolism such that less glucose is fermented and more glucose is completely oxidized.}

Reintroduction of the disease through contact with infected individuals from other areas is an important latent stochastic variable. In this study we model these stochastic processes to explain extinction and recurrence of epidemics observed in measles. We develop estimating functions for such a model and apply the methodology to temporal case counts of measles in 60 cities in England and Wales. In order to estimate the unobserved spatial contact process we suggest a method based on stochastic simulation and marginal densities. The estimation results show that it is possible to consider a unified model for the UK cities where the parameters depend on the city size. Stochastic realizations from the dynamic model realistically capture the transitions from an endemic cyclic pattern in large populations to irregular epidemic outbreaks in small human host populations.}

We report such an approach, focusing on the particularly well-documented case of measles. We propose the use of a discrete time epidemic model comprising the infected and susceptible class as state variables. The model uses a discrete time version of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered type epidemic models, which can be fitted to observed disease incidence time series. We describe a method for reconstructing the dynamics of the susceptible class, which is an unobserved state variable of the dynamical system. The model provides a remarkable fit to the data on case reports of measles in England and Wales from 1944 to 1964. Morever, its systematic part explains the well-documented predominant biennial cyclic pattern. We study the dynamic behaviour of the time series model and show that episodes of annual cyclicity, which have not previously been explained quantitatively, arise as a response to a quicker replenishment of the susceptible class during the baby boom, around 1947. },

We investigate the genetic basis of floral differences between two closely related plant taxa with highly divergent mating systems, Mimulus guttatus (large-flowered outcrosser) and M. nasutus (small-flowered selfer). We had previously constructed a framework genetic linkage map of the hybrid genome containing 174 markers spanning approximately 1800 cM on 14 linkage groups. In this study, we analyze the genetics of 16 floral, reproductive, and vegetative characters measured in a large segregating M. nasutus X M. guttatus F, population (N = 526) and in replicates of the parental lines and F] hybrids. Phenotypic analyses reveal strong genetic correlations among floral traits and epistatic breakdown of male and female fertility traits in the F, hybrids. We use multitrait composite interval mapping to jointly locate and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying interspecific differences in seven floral traits. We identified 24 floral QTLs, most of which affected multiple traits. The large number of QTLs affecting each trait (mean 13, range 11-15) indicates a strikingly polygenic basis for floral divergence in this system. In general, QTL effects are small relative to both interspecific differences and environmental variation within genotypes, ruling out QTLs of major effect as contributors to floral divergence between M. guttatus and M. nasutus. QTLs show no pattern of directional dominance. Floral characters associated with pollinator attraction (corolla width) and self-pollen deposition (stigma-anther distance) share several pleiotropic or linked QTLs, but unshared QTLs may have allowed selfing to evolve independently from flower size. We discuss the polygenic nature of divergence between M. nasutus and M. guttatus in light of theoretical work on the evolution of: selfing, genetics of adaptation, and maintenance of variation within populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Aging or senescence is an age-dependent decline in physiological function, demographically manifest as decreased survival and fecundity with increasing age. Since aging is disadvantageous it should not evolve by natural selection. So why do organisms age and die? In the 1940s and 1950s evolutionary geneticists resolved this paradox by positing that aging evolves because selection is inefficient at maintaining function late in life. By the 1980s and 1990s this evolutionary theory of aging had received firm empirical support, but little was known about the mechanisms of aging. Around the same time biologists began to apply the tools of molecular genetics to aging and successfully identified mutations that affect longevity. Today. the molecular genetics of aging is a burgeoning field, but progress in evolutionary genetics of aging has largely stalled. Here we argue that some of the most exciting and unresolved questions about aging require an integration of molecular and evolutionary approaches. Is aging a universal process? Why do species age at different rates? Are the mechanisms of aging conserved or lineage-specific? Are longevity genes identified in the laboratory under selection in natural populations? What is the genetic basis of plasticity in aging in response to environmental cues and is this plasticity adaptive? What are the mechanisms underlying trade-offs between early fitness traits and life span? To answer these questions evolutionary biologists must adopt the tools of molecular biology, while molecular biologists must put their experiments into an evolutionary framework. The time is ripe for a synthesis of molecular biogerontology and the evolutionary biology of aging. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. },

  Abstract                 = {It is generally accepted that the translation rate depends on the availability of cognate aa-tRNAs. In this study it is shown that the key factor that determines translation rate is the competition between near-cognate and cognate aa-tRNAs. The transport mechanism in the cytoplasm is diffusion, thus the competition between cognate, near-cognate and non-cognate aa-tRNAs to bind to the ribosome is a stochastic process. Two competition measures are introduced; C(i) and R(i) (i=1, 64) are quotients of the arrival frequencies of near-cognates vs. cognates and non-cognates vs. cognates, respectively. Furthermore, the reaction rates of bound cognates differ from those of bound near-cognates. If a near-cognate aa-tRNA binds to the A site of the ribosome, it may be rejected at the anti-codon recognition step or proofreading step or it may be accepted. Regardless of its fate, the near-cognates and non-cognates have caused delays of varying duration to the observed rate of translation. Rate constants have been measured at a temperature of 20 degrees C by (Gromadski, K.B., Rodnina, M.V., 2004. Kinetic determinants of high-fidelity tRNA discrimination on the ribosome. Mol. Cell 13, 191-200). These rate constants have been re-evaluated at 37 degrees C, using experimental data at 24.5 degrees C and 37 degrees C (Varenne, S., et al., 1984. Translation in a non-uniform process: effect of tRNA availability on the rate of elongation of nascent polypeptide chains. J. Mol. Biol. 180, 549-576). The key results of the study are: (i) the average time (at 37 degrees C) to add an amino acid, as defined by the ith codon, to the nascent peptide chain is: tau(i)=9.06+1.445x[10.48C(i)+0.5R(i)] (in ms); (ii) the misreading frequency is directly proportional to the near-cognate competition, E(i)=0.0009C(i); (iii) the competition from near-cognates, and not the availability of cognate aa-tRNAs, is the most important factor that determines the translation rate - the four codons with highest near-cognate competition (in the case of E. coli) are [GCC]>[CGG]>[AGG]>[GGA], which overlap only partially with the rarest codons: [AGG]<[CCA]<[GCC]<[CAC]; (iv) based on the kinetic rates at 37 degrees C, the average time to insert a cognate amino acid is 9.06ms and the average delay to process a near-cognate aa-tRNA is 10.45ms and (vii) the model also provides estimates of the vacancy times of the A site of the ribosome - an important factor in frameshifting.},

  Abstract                 = {Heterochromatin is defined by distinct posttranslational modifications on histones, such as methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 ( H3K9), which allows heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1)- related chromodomain proteins to bind. Heterochromatin is frequently found near CENP-A chromatin, which is the key determinant of kinetochore assembly. We have discovered that the RNA interference ( RNAi)- directed heterochromatin flanking the central kinetochore domain at fission yeast centromeres is required to promote CENPA(Cnp1) and kinetochore assembly over the central domain. The H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 ( Suv39); the ribonuclease Dicer, which cleaves heterochromatic double- stranded RNA to small interfering RNA ( siRNA); Chp1, a component of the RNAi effector complex ( RNA- induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing; RITS); and Swi6 ( HP1) are required to establish CENP-A(Cnp1) chromatin on naive templates. Once assembled, CENP-A(Cnp1) chromatin is propagated by epigenetic means in the absence of heterochromatin. Thus, another, potentially conserved, role for centromeric RNAi- directed heterochromatin has been identified. },

A similar effect is seen when the activity of nutrient-sensing pathways is reduced by mutations or chemical inhibitors. In rodents, both dietary restriction and decreased nutrient-sensing pathway activity can lower the incidence of age-related loss of function and disease, including tumors and neurodegeneration. Dietary restriction also increases life span and protects against diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in rhesus monkeys, and in humans it causes changes that protect against these age-related pathologies. Tumors and diabetes are also uncommon in humans with mutations in the growth hormone receptor, and natural genetic variants in nutrient-sensing pathways are associated with increased human life span. Dietary restriction and reduced activity of nutrient-sensing pathways may thus slow aging by similar mechanisms, which have been conserved during evolution. We discuss these findings and their potential application to prevention of age-related disease and promotion of healthy aging in humans, and the challenge of possible negative side effects.},

Such functions induce complex value landscapes on the space of sequences.The landscapes are analysed by random walk techniques, in particular autocorrelation functions and correlation lengths are computed. Free energy landscapes were found to be of AR(1) type. The rate constant landscapes, however, turned out to be more complex. In addition, gradient and adaptive walks are performed in order to get more insight into the complex structure of the landscapes. },

However, our results suggest that even in the absence of any direct selective advantage, genotypic modularity may increase through the formation of new subfunctions under near-neutral processes. Two subfunctions may be formed from a single ancestral subfunction by the process of fission. Subfunction fission occurs when multiple functions under unified genetic control become subdivided into more restricted functions under independent genetic control. Provided that population size is sufficiently small, random generic drift and mutation can conspire to produce changes in the number of subfunctions in the genome of a species without necessarily altering the phenotype. Extensive genotypic modularity may then accrue in a near-neutral fashion in permissive population-genetic environments, potentially opening novel pathways to morphological evolution. Many aspects of gene complexity in multicellular eukaryotes may have arisen passively as population size reductions accompanied increases in organism size, with the adaptive exploitation of such complexity occurring secondarily.},

  Abstract                 = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates. For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation.Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene.Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely.Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.Cooke et al. 1997 (p. 362)},

  Abstract                 = { A model of host-parasite coevolution is analysed. A host resistance trait and a parasite virulence trait interact to determine the outcome of a parasitic attack, where each trait is determined by quantitative genetic variation. The resistance and virulence traits are assumed to have a fitness cost. Each host and parasite genotype is treated as a separate 'species' in a multidimensional Lotka-Volterra system in which the numerical abundance of each genotype is free to change. Thus, the epidemiological effects of fluctuating population sizes are analysed jointly with changes in genotype frequencies. Population sizes fluctuate increasingly as the parasites' reproductive capacity increases and as resistance and virulence benefits per unit cost decline. The patterns of genetic variability depend mainly on the stability of population sizes and on the shape of the relationship between the costs and benefits of a trait. },

  Abstract                 = {George Price studied evolutionary genetics for approximately seven years between 1967 and 1974. During that brief period Price made three lasting contributions to evolutionary theory; these were: (i) the Price Equation, a profound insight into the nature of selection and the basis for the modern theories of kin and group selection; (ii) the theory of games and animal behavior, based on the concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy; and (iii) the modern interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, Fisher's theorem being perhaps the most cited and least understood idea in the history of evolutionary genetics. This paper summarizes Price's contributions and briefly outlines why, toward the end of his painful intellectual journey, he chose to focus his deep humanistic feelings and sharp, analytical mind on abstract problems in evolutionary theory.

  Abstract                 = {A general framework is presented to unify diverse models of natural selection. This framework is based on the Price Equation, with two additional steps. First, characters are described by their multiple regression on a set of predictor variables. The most common predictors in genetics are alleles and their interactions, but any predictor may be used. The second step is to describe fitness by multiple regression on characters. Once again, characters may be chosen arbitrarily. This expanded Price Equation provides an exact description of total evolutionary change under all conditions, and for all systems of inheritance and selection. The model is first used for a new proof of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. The relations are then made clear among Fisher's theorem, Robertson's covariance theorem for quantitative genetics, the Lande-Arnold model for the causal analysis of natural selection, and Hamilton's rule for kin selection. Each of these models is a partial analysis of total evolutionary change. The Price Equation extends each model to an exact, total analysis of evolutionary change for any system of inheritance and selection. This exact analysis is used to develop an expanded Hamilton's rule for total change. The expanded rule clarifies the distinction between two types of kin selection coefficients. The first measures components of selection caused by correlated phenotypes of social partners. The second measures components of heritability via transmission by direct and indirect components of fitness.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomes of some parasites contain dozens of alternative and highly diverged surface antigens, of which only a single one is expressed in any cell. Individual cells occasionally change expression of their surface antigen, allowing them to escape immune surveillance. These switches appear to occur in a partly random way, creating a diverse set of antigenic variants. In spite of this diversity, the parasitemia develops as a series of outbreaks, in which each outbreak is dominated by relatively few antigenic types. Host-specific immunity eventually clears the dominant antigenic types, and a new Outbreak follows from antigenic types that have apparently been present all along at low frequency. This pattern of sequential dominance by different antigenic types remains unexplained. We review the five most prominent theories, which have developed mainly from studies of the protozoans Trypanosoma and Plasmodium, and the bacterial spirochete Borrelia. The most promising theories depend on some combination of mechanisms to create favored connectivity pathways through the matrix of transitions between variants. Favored pathways may arise from biased switches at the molecular level of gene expression or front biases imposed by immune selection. We illustrate the concept of connectivity pathways by reanalysis of data on transitions between variants from Borrelia hermsii. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. }

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary conflicts cause opponents to push increasingly hard and in opposite directions on the regulation of traits. One can see only the intermediate outcome from the balance of the exaggerated and opposed forces. Intermediate expression hides the underlying conflict, potentially misleading one to conclude that trait regulation is designed to achieve efficient and robust expression, rather than arising by the precarious resolution of conflict. Perturbation often reveals the underlying nature of evolutionary conflict. Upon mutation or knockout of one side in the conflict, the other previously hidden and exaggerated push on the trait may cause extreme, pathological expression. In this regard, pathology reveals hidden evolutionary design. We first review several evolutionary conflicts between males and females, including conflicts over mating, fertilization, and the growth rate of offspring. Perturbations of these conflicts lead to infertility, misregulated growth, cancer, behavioral abnormalities, and psychiatric diseases. We then turn to antagonism between the sexes over traits present in both males and females. For many traits, the different sexes favor different phenotypic values, and constraints prevent completely distinct expression in the sexes. In this case of sexual antagonism, we present a theory of conflict between X-linked genes and autosomal genes. We suggest that dysregulation of the exaggerated conflicting forces between the X chromosome and the autosomes may be associated with various pathologies caused by extreme expression along the male-female axis. Rapid evolution of conflicting X-linked and autosomal genes may cause divergence between populations and speciation. },

However, biological function has been assigned to only a small proportion of the predicted genes in any animal. Here we have used RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to target nearly 90\% of predicted genes on C. elegans chromosome I by feeding worms with bacteria that express double-stranded RNA. We have assigned function to 13.9\% of the genes analysed, increasing the number of sequenced genes with known phenotypes on chromosome I from 70 to 378. Although most genes with sterile or embryonic lethal RNAi phenotypes are involved in basal cell metabolism, many genes giving post-embryonic phenotypes have conserved sequences but unknown function. In addition, conserved genes are significantly more likely to have an RNAi phenotype than are genes with no conservation. We have constructed a reusable library of bacterial clones that will permit unlimited RNAi screens in the future; this should help develop a more complete view of the relationships between the genome, gene function and the environment. }

  Abstract                 = {The natural course of HIV-1 infection is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in viral load, not just within patients over time, but also between patients, especially during the asymptomatic stage of infection. Asymptomatic, or set-point, viral load has been shown to correlate with both decreased time to AIDS and increased infectiousness. The aim of this study is to characterize the epidemiological impact of heterogeneity in set-point viral load. By analyzing two cohorts of untreated patients, we quantify the relationships between both viral load and infectiousness and the duration of the asymptomatic infectious period. We find that, because both the duration of infection and infectiousness determine the opportunities for the virus to be transmitted, this suggests a trade-off between these contributions to the overall transmission potential. Some public health implications of variation in set-point viral load are discussed. We observe that set-point viral loads are clustered around those that maximize the transmission potential, and this leads us to hypothesize that HIV-1 could have evolved to optimize its transmissibility, a form of adaptation to the human host population. We discuss how this evolutionary hypothesis can be tested, review the evidence available to date, and highlight directions for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {All organisms have elaborate mechanisms to control rates of protein production. However, protein production is also subject to stochastic fluctuations, or "noise." Several recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and \emph{Escherichia coli} have investigated the relationship between transcription and translation rates and stochastic fluctuations in protein levels, or more generally, how such randomness is a function of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However, the fundamental question of whether stochasticity in protein expression is generally biologically relevant has not been addressed, and it remains unknown whether random noise in the protein production rate of most genes significantly affects the fitness of any organism. We propose that organisms should be particularly sensitive to variation in the protein levels of two classes of genes: genes whose deletion is lethal to the organism and genes that encode subunits of multiprotein complexes. Using an experimentally verified model of stochastic gene expression in S. cerevisiae, we estimate the noise in protein production for nearly every yeast gene, and confirm our prediction that the production of essential and complex-forming proteins involves lower levels of noise than does the production of most other genes. Our results support the hypothesis that noise in gene expression is a biologically important variable, is generally detrimental to organismal fitness, and is subject to natural selection. },

Such coevolution at the amino acid-sequence level is well documented and has been used to predict interacting proteins, domains, and amino acids. Interacting proteins are also often precisely coexpressed with one another, presumably to maintain proper stoichiometry among interacting components. Here, we show that the expression levels of physically interacting proteins coevolve. We estimate average expression levels of genes from four closely related fungi of the genus Saccharomyces using the codon adaptation index and show that expression levels of interacting proteins exhibit coordinated changes in these different species. We find that this coevolution of expression is a more powerful predictor of physical interaction than is coevolution of amino acid sequence. These results demonstrate that gene expression levels can coevolve, adding another dimension to the study of the coevolution of interacting proteins and underscoring the importance of maintaining coexpression of interacting proteins over evolutionary time. Our results also suggest that expression coevolution can be used for computational prediction of protein-protein interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genetic diversity is a major obstacle for the design of a successful vaccine. Certain viral polymorphisms encode human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-associated immune escape, potentially overcoming limited vaccine protection. Although transmission of immune escape variants has been reported, the overall extent to which this phenomenon occurs in populations and the degree to which it contributes to HIV-1 viral evolution are unknown. Selection on the HIV-1 env gene at transmission favors neutralization-sensitive variants, but it is not known to what degree selection acts on the internal HIV-1 proteins to restrict or enhance the transmission of immune escape variants. Studies have suggested that HLA class I may determine susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, but a definitive role for HLA at transmission remains unproven. Comparing populations of acute seroconverters and chronically infected patients, we found no evidence of selection acting to restrict transmission of HIV-1 variants. We found that statistical associations previously reported in chronic infection between viral polymorphisms and HLA class I alleles are not present in acute infection, suggesting that the majority of viral polymorphisms in these patients are the result of transmission rather than de novo adaptation. Using four episodes of HIV-1 transmission in which the donors and recipients were both sampled very close to the time of infection we found that, despite a transmission bottleneck, genetic variants of HIV-1 infection are transmitted in a frequency-dependent manner. As HIV-1 infections are seeded by unique donor-adapted viral variants, each episode is a highly individual antigenic challenge. Host-specific, idiosyncratic HIV-1 antigenic diversity will seriously tax the efficacy of immunization based on consensus sequences. },

RF1 and RF2 discriminate against sense codons related to stop codons by between 3 and more than 6 orders of magnitude. This high level of accuracy is obtained without energy-driven error correction (proofreading), in contrast to codon-dependent amino-acyl-{tRNA} recognition by ribosomes, Two codons, UAU and UGG, stand out as hotspots for RF-dependent premature termination. },

Recently, protein expression data for the whole yeast genome was published. We investigate which properties of coding DNA sequences can be used to predict expression levels. The new algorithm by Carbone et al. for computing dominating codon bias in a genome is evaluated. It is concluded that it works at least as well as existing methods, and eliminates the need to arbitrarily choose a set of highly expressed genes. Also, the hypothesis that information on codon pair frequencies can be used to predict expression is investigated. Our conclusion is that codon pairs do not contribute more information than do single codon frequencies. Overall correlation between predicted and actual expression data using properties of coding DNA sequences is around 0.65. Hence, while being a useful source of information, the expression levels predicted by these methods should only be used as a rule of thumb. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd. }

We describe two variants of the index, how to combine various such indices to a single one and an efficient algorithm for their computation. A statistical analysis of gene expression groups indicate that cell cycle genes have high TPI. This result is independent of other biases like GC content and codon bias. Furthermore, we find an additional unexpected codon bias that seems related to a context sensitive DNA repair.}

  Abstract                 = {We propose a discrete-time Bayesian hierarchical model for the population dynamics of the great gerbil-flea ecological system. The model accounts for the sampling variability arising from data originally collected for other purposes. The prior for the unknown population densities incorporates specific biological hypotheses regarding the interacting dynamics of the two species, as well as their life cycles, where density-dependent effects are included. Posterior estimates are obtained via Markov chain Monte Carlo. The variance of the observed density estimates is a quadratic function of the unknown density. Our study indicates the presence of a density-dependent growth rate for the gerbil population. For the flea population there is clear evidence of density-dependent over-summer net growth, which is dependent on the flea-to-gerbil ratio at the beginning of the reproductive summer. Over-winter net growth is favored by high density. We estimate that on average 35\% of the gerbil population survives the winter. Our study shows that hierarchical Bayesian models can be useful in extracting ecobiological information from observational data.},

We demonstrate in yeast that mRNAs lacking all termination codons are as labile as nonsense transcripts. Decay of "nonstop" transcripts in yeast requires translation but is mechanistically distinguished from NMD and the major mRNA turnover pathway that requires deadenylation, decapping, and 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic decay. These data suggest that nonstop decay is initiated when the ribosome reaches the 3' terminus of the message. We demonstrate multiple physiologic sources of nonstop transcripts and conservation of their accelerated decay in mammalian cells.

Several attempts have been made recently to improve Wright's estimate of N-c, but the methods that work in cases where a gene encodes a protein not containing all amino acids with degenerate codons have not been tested against each other. In this article I derive five new estimators of N-c and test them together with the two published estimators, using resampling under rigorous testing conditions. Estimation of codon homozygosity, E, turns out to he a key to the estimation of N-c. F can be estimated in two closely related ways, corresponding to sampling with or without replacement, the latter being what Wright used. The N-c methods that are based on sampling without replacement showed Much better accuracy at short gene lengths than those based on sampling with replacement, indicating that Wright's homozygosity method is superior. Surprisingly, the methods based on sampling with replacement displayed a Superior correlation with {mRNA} levels in \emph{Escherichia coli}. },

Accounting for background nucleotide composition when measuring codon usage bias. Mol Biol Evol 19:1390-4). In this letter, its properties are under the loupe, with special emphasis on phenomena relating to codon homozygosity. A theoretical misunderstanding regarding this estimator is explained in detail, notably Nc varies between 0 and 61 instead of 20 and 61 (with the standard genetic code). Practical examples from the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are given which demonstrate that the problem is not just theoretical. }

In this paper I provide a clear and practically meaningful definition of bias discrepancy (BD; when the degree of codon bias varies within a degeneracy class). Moreover I evaluate the impact of BD and amino acid usage on estimates of Nc. It is shown that both factors have a significant effect on accuracy and precision. Both amino acid usage and BID influence accuracy considerably, especially in short genes. Finally, I demonstrate how the definition of bias discrepancy can be applied to investigate if codon usage is influenced by selection and I discuss this test in relation to the incongruous literature that exists for Buchnera sp.

  Abstract                 = {The MDR1 (ABCB1) gene encodes a membrane-bound transporter that actively effluxes a wide range of compounds from cells. The overexpression of MDR1 by multidrug-resistant cancer cells is a serious impediment to chemotherapy. MDR1 is expressed in various tissues to protect them from the adverse effect of toxins. The pharmacokinetics of drugs that are also MDR1 substrates also influence disease outcome and treatment efficacy. Although MDR1 is a well-conserved gene, there. is increasing evidence that its polymorphisms affect substrate specificity. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occur frequently and have strong linkage, creating a common haplotype at positions 1236C>T (G412G), 2677G>T (A893S) and 3435C>T (111451). The frequency of the synonymous 3435C>T polymorphism has been shown to vary significantly according to ethnicity. Existing literature suggests that the haplotype plays a role in response to drugs and disease susceptibility. This review summarizes recent findings on the 3435C>T polymorphism of MDR1 and the haplotype to which it belongs. A possible molecular mechanism of action by ribosome stalling that can change protein structure and function by altering protein folding is discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V. },

  Abstract                 = {The increasing availability of sequenced genomes enables the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of large protein complexes. Here, we trace the evolution of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I), which has increased in size, by so-called supernumary subunits, from 14 subunits in the bacteria to 30 in the plants and algae, 37 in the fungi and 46 in the mammals. Using a combination of pair-wise and profile-based sequence comparisons at the levels of proteins and the DNA of the sequenced eukaryotic genomes, combined with phylogenetic analyses to establish orthology relationships, we were able to (1) trace the origin of six of the supernumerary subunits to the alpha-proteobacterial ancestor of the mitochondria, (2) detect previously unidentified homology relations between subunits from fungi and mammals, (3) detect previously unidentified subunits in the genomes of several species and (4) document several cases of gene duplications among supernumerary subunits in the eukaryotes. One of these, a duplication of N7BM (B17.2), is particularly interesting as it has been lost from genomes that have also lost Complex I proteins, making it a candidate for a Complex I interacting protein. A parsimonious reconstruction of eukaryotic Complex I evolution shows an initial increase in size that predates the separation of plants, fungi and metazoa, followed by a gradual adding and incidental losses of subunits in the various evolutionary lineages. This evolutionary scenario is in contrast to that for Complex I in the prokaryotes, for which the combination of several separate, and previously independently functioning modules into a single complex has been proposed.

This behavior is proved by unequivocal amino acid sequence data? showing a protein that lacks the bypassed sequence encoded between the hungry codon and specific landing sites. The landing sites are codons cognate to the anticodon of the peptidyl-{tRNA}. the efficiency of this behavior can be as high as 10-20PERCENT but declines with the length of the slide. Interposition of "trap" sites (nonproductive landing sites) in the bypassed region reduces the frequency of successful slides, confirming that the ribosome-peptidyl-{tRNA} complex passes through the untranslated region of the message. This behavior appears to be quite general: it can occur at the two kinds of hungry codons tested, AUA and AAG; the sliding peptidyl-{tRNA} can be any of three species tested, phenylalanine, tyrosine, or leucine {tRNA}; the peptidyl component can be either of two very different peptide sequences; and translation can resume at any of the three codons tested.}

Although the mechanism by which either determinant functions remains poorly characterized, the interaction between the poly(A) tail-poly(A)-binding protein complex and events occurring at the 5' terminus during translation initiation has been an intriguing possibility. In this report, the mutual dependence of the cap and the poly(A) tail was studied. Poly(A)+ and poly(A)- luciferase (Luc) {mRNA}s generated \emph{in vitro} containing or lacking a cap were translated \emph{in vivo} in tobacco protoplasts, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and yeast following delivery by electroporation. The poly(A) tail-mediated regulation of translational efficiency was wholly dependent on the cap for function. Moreover, cap function was enhanced over an order of magnitude by the presence of a poly(A) tail. The relative differences in stability between the {mRNA}s could not account for the synergism. The synergism between the cap and poly(A) tail was not observed in yeast cells in which active translation had been disrupted. In addition, the synergism was not observed in in vitro translation lysates. These data demonstrate that the cap and the poly(A) tail are interdependent for optimal function in vivo and suggest that communication between the two regulatory determinants may be important in establishing efficient translation. }

Epidemiological models have shown the importance of the diversity of potential hosts for understanding the dynamics of infectious disease (e.g., the importance of reservoirs), but the consequences of this diversity for virulence and transmission evolution remain largely overlooked. Here, I present a general theoretical framework for the study of life-history evolution of multihost parasites. This analysis highlights the importance of epidemiology (the relative quality and quantity of different types of infected hosts) and between-trait constraints (both within and between different hosts) to parasite evolution. I illustrate these effects in different transmission scenarios under the simplifying assumption that parasites can infect only two types of hosts. These simple but contrasted evolutionary scenarios yield new insights into virulence evolution and the evolution of transmission routes among different hosts. Because many of the pathogens that have large public-health and agricultural impacts have complex life cycles, an understanding of their evolutionary dynamics could hold substantial benefits for management. },

In this paper, we use these models to examine how the level of virulence to which a parasite evolves, depends on factors such as the relationship between parasite density and its rate of transmission from infected hosts, and the mechanism of parasite-induced pathogenesis. We show that changes in the terms describing transmissibility and pathogenesis may lead to dramatic differences in the level of virulence to which a parasite evolves. This suggests that no single factor is likely to be responsible for the differences in virulence of different parasites, and that understanding of the evolution of virulence of parasites will require a detailed quantitative understanding of the interaction between the parasite and its host.

  Abstract                 = {Why do parasites harm their hosts? the general understanding is that if the transmission rate and virulence of a parasite are linked, then the parasite must harm its host to maximize its transmission. The exact nature of such trade-offs remains largely unclear, but for vertebrate hosts it probably involves interactions between a microparasite and the host immune system. Previous results have suggested that in a homogeneous host population in the absence of superor coinfection, within-host dynamics lead to selection of the parasite with an intermediate growth rate that is just being controlled by the immune system before it kills the host (Antia et al. 1994). In this paper, we examine how this result changes when heterogeneity is introduced to the host population. We incorporate the simplest form of heterogeneity-random heterogeneity in the parameters describing the size of the initial parasite inoculum. the immune response of the host, and the lethal density at which the parasite kills the host. We find that the general conclusion of the previous model holds: parasites evolve some intermediate growth rate. However, in contrast with the generally accepted view. we find that virulence (measured by the case mortality or the rate of parasite-induced host mortality) increases with heterogeneity. Finally, we link the within-host and between-host dynamics of parasites. We show how the parameters for epidemiological spread of the disease can be estimated from the within-host dynamics, and in doing so examine the way in which trade-offs between these epidemiological parameters arise as a consequence of the interaction of the parasite and the immune response of the host. }

Recently, there have been a few attempts at estimating the costs of CTL escape mutations in terms of the reduction in viral fitness and the killing rate at which the CTL response specific to one viral epitope clears virus-infected cells. Using a mathematical model we show that estimation of both parameters depends critically on the underlying changes in the replication rate of the virus and the changes in the killing rate over time (which in previous studies were assumed to be constant). We provide a theoretical basis for estimation of these parameters using \emph{in vivo} data. In particular, we show that 1) by assuming unlimited virus growth one can obtain a minimal estimate of the fitness cost of the escape mutation, and 2) by assuming no virus growth during the escape, one can obtain a minimal estimate of the average killing rate. We also discuss the conditions under which better estimates of the average killing rate can be obtained. }

  Abstract                 = {Syntheses of protein molecules in a cell are carried out by ribosomes. A ribosome can be regarded as a molecular motor which utilizes the input chemical energy to move on a messenger RNA (mRNA) track that also serves as a template for the polymerization of the corresponding protein. The forward movement, however, is characterized by an alternating sequence of translocation and pause. Using a quantitative model, which captures the mechanochemical cycle of an individual ribosome, we derive an exact analytical expression for the distribution of its dwell times at the successive positions on the mRNA track. Inverse of the average dwell time satisfies a "Michaelis-Menten-type" equation and is consistent with the general formula for the average velocity of a molecular motor with an unbranched mechanochemical cycle. Extending this formula appropriately, we also derive the exact force-velocity relation for a ribosome. Often many ribosomes simultaneously move on the same mRNA track, while each synthesizes a copy of the same protein. We extend the model of a single ribosome by incorporating steric exclusion of different individuals on the same track. We draw the phase diagram of this model of ribosome traffic in three-dimensional spaces spanned by experimentally controllable parameters. We suggest new experimental tests of our theoretical predictions. },

The form of the distribution, which fits best with our simulation data, is consistent with that extracted from the experimental data. For our computations, we use a model that captures both the mechanochemistry of each individual ribosome and their steric interactions. We also demonstrate the effects of the sequence inhomogeneities of real genes on the fluctuations and noise in translation. Finally, inspired by recent advances in the experimental techniques of manipulating single ribosomes, we make theoretical predictions on the force-velocity relation for individual ribosomes.

  Abstract                 = {Although plant disease epidemiology has focused on populations in which all host plants have the same genotype, mixtures of host genotypes are more typical of natural populations and offer promising options for deployment of resistance genes in agriculture. In this review, we discuss Leonard's classic model of the effects of host genotype diversity on disease and its predictions of disease level based on the proportion of susceptible host tissue. As a refinement to Leonard's model, the spatial structure of host and pathogen population can be taken into account by considering factors such as autoinfection, interaction between host size and pathogen dispersal gradients, lesion expansion, and host carrying capacity for disease. The genetic composition of the host population also can be taken into account by considering differences in race-specific resistance among host genotypes, compensation, plant competition, and competitive interactions among pathogen genotypes. The magnitude of host-diversity effects for particular host-pathogen systems can be predicted by considering how the inherent characteristics of a system causes it to differ from the assumptions of the classic model. Because of the limited number of studies comparing host-diversity effects in different systems, it is difficult at this point to make more than qualitative predictions. Environmental conditions and management decisions also influence host-diversity effects on disease through their effect on factors such as host density and epidemic length and intensity.}

These studies identified the role that anatomy played in a number of fundamental immunological phenomena including recirculation, induction of immune priming or tolerance, and the interactions of T and B cells. The recent resurgence of interest in the role of immune architecture and anatomy in basic immunological phenomena is almost entirely due to technological developments in identifying and tracking cells in vivo, not least through the ability to do this dynamically, in real time through the application of multiphoton microscopy. Here we outline the background to our own studies applying multiphoton microscopy to analysis of immune priming and tolerance, the role of adjuvants, Tand B-cell interactions, and the application of these studies in infectious and inflammatory diseases. We then describe the impact that real time in vivo imaging has had on these areas. Finally, we engage in some 'crystal ball gazing' to look at what developments in imaging are likely to occur, why they are important, and what further information these approaches may distill regarding the development of the immune response.},

A large set of genes (approximately 900) showed a similar drastic response to almost all of these environmental changes. Additional features of the genomic responses were specialized for specific conditions. Promoter analysis and subsequent characterization of the responses of mutant strains implicated the transcription factors Yap1p, as well as Msn2p and Msn4p, in mediating specific features of the transcriptional response, while the identification of novel sequence elements provided clues to novel regulators. Physiological themes in the genomic responses to specific environmental stresses provided insights into the effects of those stresses on the cell.},

Bioinformatic analysis of these assemblies defined 232 distinct multiprotein complexes and proposed new cellular roles for 344 proteins, including 231 proteins with no previous functional annotation. Comparison of yeast and human complexes showed that conservation across species extends from single proteins to their molecular environment. Our analysis provides an outline of the eukaryotic proteome as a network of protein complexes at a level of organization beyond binary interactions.

  Abstract                 = {A common conclusion in several recent publications devoted to the deterministic analysis of the third phase of Wright's shifting-balance theory is that under reasonable conditions phase three should proceed easily. I argue that the mathematical equations analyzed in these papers do not correspond to the biological situation they were meant to describe. I present a more appropriate study of the third base of the shifting balance. My results show that the third phase can proceed only under much more restricted conditions than the previous studies suggested. Migration should be neither too strong not too weak relative to selection. The higher peak should be sufficiently dominant over the lower peak. Recombination can greatly reduce the plausibility of this phase or completely preclude peak shifts. A very important determinant of the ultimate outcome of the competition between different peaks is the topological structure of the network of demes. Peak shifts in two-dimensional networks of demes are more difficult than in one-dimensional networks. Phase three can be accomplished easiest if it is initialed in one of the peripheral demes. },

  Abstract                 = {The "Machiavellian intelligence" hypothesis (or the "social brain" hypothesis) posits that large brains and distinctive cognitive abilities of humans have evolved via intense social competition in which social competitors developed increasingly sophisticated "Machiavellian" strategies as a means to achieve higher social and reproductive success. Here we build a mathematical model aiming to explore this hypothesis. In the model, genes control brains which invent and learn strategies (memes) which are used by males to gain advantage in competition for mates. We show that the dynamics of intelligence has three distinct phases. During the dormant phase only newly invented memes are present in the population. During the cognitive explosion phase the population's meme count and the learning ability, cerebral capacity (controlling the number of different memes that the brain can learn and use), and Machiavellian fitness of individuals increase in a runaway fashion. During the saturation phase natural selection resulting from the costs of having large brains checks further increases in cognitive abilities. Overall, our results suggest that the mechanisms underlying the "Machiavellian intelligence" hypothesis can indeed result in the evolution of significant cognitive abilities on the time scale of 10 to 20 thousand generations. We show that cerebral capacity evolves faster and to a larger degree than learning ability. Our model suggests that there may be a tendency toward a reduction in cognitive abilities (driven by the costs of having a large brain) as the reproductive advantage of having a large brain decreases and the exposure to memes increases in modern societies.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolutionary theory of aging predicts that the equilibrium gene frequency for deleterious mutations should increase with age at onset of mutation action because of weaker (postponed) selection against later-acting mutations. According to this mutation accumulation hypothesis, one would expect the genetic variability for survival (additive genetic variance) to increase with age. The ratio of additive genetic variance to the observed phenotypic variance (the heritability of longevity) can be estimated most reliably as the doubled slope of the regression line for offspring life span on paternal age at death. Thus, if longevity is indeed determined by late-acting deleterious mutations, one would expect this slope to become steeper at higher paternal ages. To test this prediction of evolutionary theory of aging, we computerized and analyzed the most reliable and accurate genealogical data on longevity in European royal and noble families. Offspring longevity for each sex (8409 records for males and 3741 records for females) was considered as a dependent variable in the multiple regression model and as a function of three independent predictors: paternal age at death (for estimation of heritability of life span), paternal age at reproduction (control for parental age effects), and cohort life expectancy (control for cohort and secular trends and fluctuations). We found that the regression slope for offspring longevity as a function of paternal longevity increases with paternal longevity, as predicted by the evolutionary theory of aging and by the mutation accumulation hypothesis in particular.},

  Abstract                 = {The gravitational evolution of the cosmic one-point probability distribution function (PDF) has been estimated using an analytic approximation that combines gravitational perturbation theory with the Edgeworth expansion around a Gaussian PDF. Despite the remarkable success of the Edgeworth expansion in modeling the weakly nonlinear growth of fluctuations around the peak of the cosmic PDF, it fails to reproduce the expected behavior in the tails of the distribution. This expansion is also ill defined, since it predicts negative densities and negative probabilities for the cosmic fields. This is a natural consequence of using an expansion around the Gaussian distribution, which is not rigorously well defined when describing a positive variate such as the density held. Here we present an alternative to the Edgeworth series based on an expansion around the gamma PDF. The gamma expansion is designed to converge when the PDF exhibits exponential tails, which are predicted by perturbation theory in the weakly nonlinear regime, and are found in numerical simulations from Gaussian initial conditions. The proposed expansion is better suited to describing a real PDF, since it always yields positive densities and the PDF is effectively positive-definite. We compare the performance of the Edgeworth and the gamma expansions for a wide dynamic range, making use of cosmological N-body simulations and assessing their range of validity. In general, the gamma expansion provides an interesting and simple alternative to the Edgeworth series, and it should be useful for modeling non-Gaussian PDFs in other contexts, such as in the cosmic microwave background. },

Misfolded proteins form insoluble aggregates and are hypothesized to be intrinsically cytotoxic. Here, we experimentally isolate a fitness cost caused by toxicity of misfolded proteins. We exclude other costs of protein misfolding, such as loss of functional protein or attenuation of growth-limiting protein synthesis resources, by comparing growth rates of budding yeast expressing folded or misfolded variants of a gratuitous protein, YFP, at equal levels. We quantify a fitness cost that increases with misfolded protein abundance, up to as much as a 3.2\% growth rate reduction when misfolded YFP represents less than 0.1\% of total cellular protein. Comparable experiments on variants of the yeast gene orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (URA3) produce similar results. Quantitative proteomic measurements reveal that, within the cell, misfolded YFP induces coordinated synthesis of interacting cytosolic chaperone proteins in the absence of a wider stress response, providing evidence for an evolved modular response to misfolded proteins in the cytosol. These results underscore the distinct and evolutionarily relevant molecular threat of protein misfolding, independent of protein function. Assuming that most misfolded proteins impose similar costs, yeast cells express almost all proteins at steady-state levels sufficient to expose their encoding genes to selection against misfolding, lending credibility to the recent suggestion that such selection imposes a global constraint on molecular evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a general framework for modelling adaptive trait dynamics in which we integrate various concepts and techniques from modern ESS-theory. The concept of evolutionarily singular strategies is introduced as a generalization of the ESS-concept. We give a full classification of the singular strategies in terms of ESS-stability, convergence stability, the ability of the singular strategy to invade other populations if initially rare itself, and the possibility of protected dimorphisms occurring within the singular strategy's neighbourhood. Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework. A haploid version of Levene's 'soft selection’ model is developed as a specific example to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics and branching in monomorphic and polymorphic populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of protein fractions isolated from 35S-radiolabeled cells provides qualitative information on intracellular amounts, 35S incorporation rates, protein modifications, and subcellular localizations of up to thousands of individual proteins. In this study we extended proteome profiling to provide quantitative data on synthesis rates of individual proteins. We combined fluorescence detection of radiolabeled proteins with SYPRO rubyTM staining and subsequent autoradiography of the same gels, thereby quantifying protein amounts and 35S incorporation. To calibrate calculation of absolute synthesis rates, we determined the amount and autoradiograph intensity of radiolabeled haptoglobin secreted by interleukin-6 pretreated HepG2 cells. This allowed us to obtain a standard calibration value for 35S incorporation per autoradiograph intensity unit. This value was used to measure protein synthesis rates during time course experiments of heat-shocked U937 cells. We measured the increasing amounts of hsp70 and calculated it by integration of the determined hsp70 synthesis rates over time. Similar results were obtained by both methods, validating our standardization procedure. Based on the assumption that the synthesis rate of proteins in a steady state of cell metabolism would essentially compensate protein degradation, we calculated biological half-lives of proteins from protein amounts and synthesis rates determined from two-dimensional gels. Calculated protein half-lives were found close to those determined by pulse-chase experiments, thus validating this new method. In conclusion, we devised a method to assess quantitative proteome profiles covering determination of individual amounts, synthesis, and turnover rates of proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {Codon usage bias of Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite, was investigated using the available DNA sequence data. Entamoeba histolytica having AT rich genome, is expected to have A and/or T at the third position of codons. Overall codon usage data analysis indicates that A and/or T ending codons are strongly biased in the coding region of this organism. However, multivariate statistical analysis suggests that there is a single major trend in codon usage variation among the genes. The genes which are supposed to be highly expressed are clustered at one end, while the majority of the putatively lowly expressed genes are clustered at the other end. The codon usage pattern is distinctly different in these two sets of genes. C ending codons are significantly higher in the putatively highly expressed genes suggesting that C ending codons are translationally optimal in this organism. In the putatively lowly expressed genes A and/or T ending codons are predominant, which suggests that compositional constraints are playing the major role in shaping codon usage variation among the lowly expressed genes. These results suggest that both mutational bias and translational selection are operational in the codon usage variation in this organism. (C) 2000 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Determining the effect of gene deletion is a fundamental approach to understanding gene function. Conventional genetic screens exhibit biases, and genes contributing to a phenotype are often missed. We systematically constructed a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants (96\% of annotated open reading frames, or ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequences dubbed 'molecular bar codes' uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7\% of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions. Our results validate the yeast gene-deletion collection as a valuable resource for functional genomics.},

Studies of the evolution of virulence typically focus on selection acting at the epidemiological or between-host level and demonstrate the importance of trade-offs between disease transmission and virulence rates. Within-host studies reach similar conclusions regarding trade-offs between transmission and virulence at the level of individual cells. Studies which examine selection at both scales assume that between and within-host selection are necessarily in conflict. We explicitly examine these ideas and assumptions using a model of within-host viral dynamics nested within a model of between-host disease dynamics. Our approach allows us to evaluate the direction of selection at the withinand between-host levels and identify situations leading to conflict and accord between the two levels of selection.

We find that for chronic infections, in the absence of trade-offs between viral life history stages, natural selection favors viral strains whose virion production rate maximizes viral burst size. We then show how various life history trade-offs such as that between virion production and immune system recognition and clearance of virally infected cells can lead to natural selection favoring production rates lower than the one that maximizes burst size. Our findings suggest that HIV replication rates should vary between cells with different life spans, as has been suggested by recent observation. Published by Elsevier Ltd. }

  Abstract                 = {Phenotypes are the products of developmental processes whose dynamics are controlled by genes. In many developmental processes there is a nonlinear relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic variation. These nonlinear relationships can result in the emergence of dominance among alleles that control the developmental process. We explore the properties of dominance relationships in a simple developmental system consisting of a diffusion-gradient-threshold mechanism commonly deployed in pattern formation. We show that a single nonlinear process (diffusion) within this integrated mechanism leads to the emergence of dominance in all components of the mechanism. Unlike the situation in metabolic pathways, where new mutations are most likely to be recessive, the structure of the nonlinearities in this developmental mechanism is such that in certain circumstances new mutations are equally likely to be dominant or recessive. Although the dominance we observe in this system is the result of a physiological process, we also find that dominance can evolve by microevolutionary mechanisms and thus are able to reconcile the opposing views of Fisher and Wright on dominance.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: To identify accurately protein function on a proteome-wide scale requires integrating data within and between high-throughput experiments. High-throughput proteomic datasets often have high rates of errors and thus yield incomplete and contradictory information. In this study, we develop a simple statistical framework using Bayes' law to interpret such data and combine information from different high-throughput experiments. In order to illustrate our approach we apply it to two protein complex purification datasets. Results: Our approach shows how to use high-throughput data to calculate accurately the probability that two proteins are part of the same complex. Importantly, our approach does not need a reference set of verified protein interactions to determine false positive and false negative error rates of protein association. We also demonstrate how to combine information from two separate protein purification datasets into a combined dataset that has greater coverage and accuracy than either dataset alone. In addition, we also provide a technique for estimating the total number of proteins which can be detected using a particular experimental technique. }

  Abstract                 = {In this study we introduce a mechanistic framework for modeling host-parasite coevolution using a nested modeling approach. The first step in this approach is to construct a mechanistic model of the parasite population dynamics within a host. The second step is to define an epidemiological model which is used to derive the fitness functions for both the host and the parasite. The within-host model is then nested within the epidemiological model by linking the epidemiological parameters such as the transmission rate of the infection or the additional host mortality rate to the dynamics of the within-host model. Nesting the within host model into an epidemiological model allows us to evaluate the fitness functions for each interactor which in turn allows us to determine the coevolutionary dynamics of the system. This nested approach has the advantage over other approaches in that mechanistic descriptions of the host-parasite biology are used to derive, rather than impose, life-history trade-offs. We illustrate this framework by analysing a simple host-parasite system. In this particular system we find that the coevolutionary equilibrium is always stable and that host survivorship and parasite fitness vary greatly with the cost of the immune response and parasite growth.

In the first part of this study we adapt a general epidemiological model to identify the appropriate fitness metric for a saprophytic filamentous fungus. We find that fungal fitness is inversely proportional to the equilibrium density of uncolonized fungal resource patches which, in turn, is a function of the expected spore production of a fungus. In the second part of this study we use a simple life history model of the same fungus within a resource patch to show that a bang-bang resource allocation strategy maximizes the expected spore production, a critical fitness component. Unlike bang-bang strategies identified in other life-history studies, we find that the optimal allocation strategy for saprophytes does not entail the use of all of the resources within a patch. }

  Abstract                 = {We present and analyse a model of protein translation at the scale of an individual messenger RNA ({mRNA}) transcript. The model we develop is unique in that it incorporates the phenomena of ribosome recycling and nonsense errors. The model conceptualizes translation as a probabilistic wave of ribosome occupancy traveling down a heterogeneous medium, the {mRNA} transcript. Our results show that the heterogeneity of the codon translation rates along the {mRNA} results in short-scale spikes and dips in the wave. Nonsense errors attenuate this wave on a longer scale while ribosome recycling reinforces it. We find that the combination of nonsense errors and codon usage bias can have a large effect on the probability that a ribosome will completely translate a transcript. We also elucidate how these forces interact with ribosome recycling to determine the overall translation rate of an {mRNA} transcript. We derive a simple cost function for nonsense errors using our model and apply this function to the yeast (Saccharomyces cervisiae) genome. Using this function we are able to detect position dependent selection on codon bias which correlates with gene expression levels as predicted a priori. These results indirectly validate our underlying model assumptions and confirm that nonsense errors can play an important role in shaping codon usage bias. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Susceptible hosts pay a fitness cost if infected. Draws on Kermack and McKendrick 1927 to calculate the fraction of the population affected by the infection $I$ which satisfies the equation, $I = 1 - \exp[I n \beta \gamma]$ where $\gamma$ is the sum of the added mortality and recovery rates. Shows that whether or not the resistance allele will be favored is a function of the ratio of the cost of resistance to the cost of infection and the expected number of affected host's (i.e. $I$). A number of interesting findings, one of which is that if the cost of resistance is small then the evolutionary equilib. density of susceptibles will be just below that of the threshold density of susceptibles. He generalizes this model to a diploid form and finds no changes in behavior. Discussion: "The difference equation (1) shows that selection for resistance to epidemics is both a frequency and density dependent form of selection." Because of this freq. dependence, the equilibrium allele freq. does not coincide with the freq. that maximizes mean fitness. "We are thus faced with yet another example of where the Fundamental Theorem of Natrual Selection does not hold for a biologically important situation." in some sense, it seems like Antonovics and Thrall (1994) and Boots and Haraguchi are just extensions of this. In fact, Antonovics and Thrall note:"Gillespie(1975), in one of the first papers to integrate epidemiologicla and genetic approaches, showed that the reate of spread of a resistance allele with costs depended ont only on allele freq. but alson on pop. density."}

  Abstract                 = {Proper functioning of biological cells requires that the process of protein expression be carried out with high efficiency and fidelity. Given an amino-acid sequence of a protein, multiple degrees of freedom still remain that may allow evolution to tune efficiency and fidelity for each gene under various conditions and cell types. Particularly, the redundancy of the genetic code allows the choice between alternative codons for the same amino acid, which, although 'synonymous,' may exert dramatic effects on the process of translation. Here we review modern developments in genomics and systems biology that have revolutionized our understanding of the multiple means by which translation is regulated. We suggest new means to model the process of translation in a richer framework that will incorporate information about gene sequences, the tRNA pool of the organism and the thermodynamic stability of the mRNA transcripts. A practical demonstration of a better understanding of the process would be a more accurate prediction of the proteome, given the transcriptome at a diversity of biological conditions.

  Abstract                 = {Classical life-history theory predicts 'trade-offs' between reproductive and somatic investments. However, empirical studies have shown that intraspecific phenotypic correlations between these two resource investments are often positive or nonsignificant, rather than negative as predicted. The model of Van Noordwijk and De Jong (1986) was proposed to explain these unexpected results. According to their model, positive correlations between reproductive and somatic investments will result if individual variation in resource acquisition exceeds that of resource allocation, whereas negative correlations will result if individual variation in resource allocation exceeds that of resource acquisition. To test this model, I used body storage/condition as an index of somatic investment because it is usually strongly related to level of resource acquisition. I predicted that laboratory studies should more often show negative correlations between reproductive and somatic investments than field studies, because individual variation in resource acquisition is expected to be lower in controlled laboratory environments than in variable natural environments. A literature review revealed that correlations between somatic (storage) investment and reproductive investment (estimated as clutch/litter mass, number of offspring per clutch/litter, or number of clutches/litters) among conspecific breeding female animals are more often positive (15 species) or nonsignificant (17 species) than negative (6 species). Moreover, as expected, five of six negative correlations were observed in laboratory studies, whereas 13 of 15 positive correlations were observed in field studies. It is concluded that future empirical and theoretical work on life histories should consider individual variation in both resource acquisition and allocation and the interaction between the two. }

However, there is a lack of awareness of their importance amongst physicians, medical researchers, and educators, all of whom tend to focus on the mechanistic (proximate) basis for disease, excluding consideration of evolutionary (ultimate) reasons. The key principles of evolutionary medicine are that selection acts on fitness, not health or longevity; that our evolutionary history does not cause disease, but rather impacts on our risk of disease in particular environments; and that we are now living in novel environments compared to those in which we evolved. We consider these evolutionary principles in conjunction with population genetics and describe several pathways by which evolutionary processes can affect disease risk. These perspectives provide a more cohesive framework for gaining insights into the determinants of health and disease. Coupled with complementary insights offered by advances in genomic, epigenetic, and developmental biology research, evolutionary perspectives offer an important addition to understanding disease. Further, there are a number of aspects of evolutionary medicine that can add considerably to studies in other domains of contemporary evolutionary studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Chemical insecticides are critical components of malaria control programs. Their ability to eliminate huge numbers of mosquitoes allows them to swiftly interrupt disease transmission, but that lethality also imposes immense selection for insecticide resistance. Targeting control at the small portion of the mosquito population actually responsible for transmitting malaria parasites to humans would reduce selection for resistance, yet maintain effective malaria control. Here, we ask whether simply lowering the concentration of the active ingredient in insecticide formulations could preferentially kill mosquitoes infected with malaria and/or those that are potentially infectious, namely, old mosquitoes. Using modified WHO resistance-monitoring assays, we exposed uninfected Anopheles stephensi females to low concentrations of the pyrethroid permethrin at days 4, 8, 12, and 16 days post-emergence and monitored survival for at least 30 days to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of repeated exposure as mosquitoes aged. We also exposed Plasmodium chabaudiand P. yoelii-infected An. stephensi females. Permethrin exposure did not consistently increase mosquito susceptibility to subsequent insecticide exposure, though older mosquitoes were more susceptible. A blood meal slightly improved survival after insecticide exposure; malaria infection did not detectably increase insecticide susceptibility. Exposure to low concentrations over successive feeding cycles substantially altered cohort age-structure. Our data suggest the possibility that, where high insecticide coverage can be achieved, low concentration formulations have the capacity to reduce disease transmission without the massive selection for resistance imposed by current practice.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of the present paper is to study the evolutionary dynamics of selfish replicators in a constant genetic background. Selfish replicators are viewed as alleles at a single locus, having a pleiotropic effect. Infinitely many alleles are possible; they act on individual fitness and have various levels of ability to distort segregation. This results in a two-level process of selection, including inter-individual selection (effect on individual fitness) and intra-individual selection (ability to distort segregation). The model takes other parameters into account, such as dominance, inbreeding and inbreeding depression. The system can have two different behaviours. (1) In some cases, evolutionary cycles are possible. The cycles correspond to an alternation of phases with predominant inter-individual selection, corresponding to major-effect mutations, and phases with predominant intra-individual selection, corresponding to small-effect mutations. (2) For other values of the parameters, a synthetic fitness can be defined: this absolute allelic fitness is estimated as a function of one's fitness due to both inter-individual and intra-individual selection. During the course of evolution, the synthetic fitness increases. The optimisation of a synthetic fitness is the most general process. The optimised value is essentially homologous to the value optimised for resource allocation to male and female function in hermaphrodites (female function being homologous to the effect on individual fitness, and male function being homologous to distortion ability). The relative importance of both behaviours is discussed. It is argued that repeated sequences causing some human degenerative hereditary diseases may follow a two-step evolutionary process: a progressive increase in number of sequences accompanied by a decrease of the individual fitness would be followed by massive elimination of such sequences. But in general the optimisation of the synthetic fitness seems to be more likely.},

Codon usage is receiving more and more focus because codon biases might be valuable tools to predict and optimize gene/protein expression. How good any of these measures is for correlating codon usage with gene and protein expression has yet to be investigated. In this study, we correlated gene transcript levels in Escherichia coli with codon usage, using a number of different codon bias measures. We found that there is a significant correlation between transcript levels and codon bias measures, suggesting that these measures can be used to assess or predict gene expression. The codon bias measure performing best in this context was the codon adaptation index. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. }

  Abstract                 = {The monofunctional penicillin-binding oo-peptidases and penicillin-hydrolyzing serine beta-lactamases diverged from a common ancestor by the acquisition of structural changes in the polypeptide chain while retaining the same folding three-motif amino acid sequence signature, serine-assisted catalytic mechanism, and active-site topology. Fusion events gave rise to multimodular penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The acyl serine transferase penicillin-binding (PB) module possesses the three active-site defining motifs of the superfamily; it is linked to the carboxy end of a non-penicillin-binding (n-PB) module through a conserved fusion site; the two modules form a single polypeptide chain which folds on the exterior of the plasma membrane and is anchored by a transmembrane spanner; and the full-size PBPs cluster into two classes, A and B. In the class A PBPs, the n-PB modules are a continuum of diverging sequences; they possess a five-motif amino acid sequence signature, and conserved dicarboxylic amino acid residues are probably elements of the glycosyl transferase catalytic center. The PB modules fall into five subclasses: A1 and A2 in gram-negative bacteria and A3, A4 and A5 in gram-positive bacteria. The foil-size class A PBPs combine the required enzymatic activities for peptidoglycan assembly from lipid-transported disaccharide-peptide units and almost certainly prescribe different, PB-module specific traits in peptidoglycan cross-linking. In the class B PBPs, the PB and n-PB modules cluster in a concerted manner: A PB module of subclass B2 or B3 is linked to an n-PB module of subclass B2 or B3 gram-negative bacteria, and a PB module of subclass B1, B4, or B5 is linked to an n-PB module of subclass B1, B4, or B5 in gram-positive bacteria. Class B PBPs are involved in cell morphogenesis. The three motifs borne by the n-PB modules are probably sites for module-module interaction and the polypeptide stretches which extend between motifs 1 and 2 are sites for protein-protein interaction. The full-size class B PBPs are an assortment of orthologs and paralogs, which prescribe traits as complex as wall expansion and septum formation. PBPs of subclass B1 are unique to gram-positive bacteria. They are not essential brit they represent an important mechanism of resistance to penicillin among the enterococci and staphylococci. Natural evolution and PBPand beta-lactamase-mediated resistance show that the ability of the catalytic centers to adapt their. properties to new situations is limitless. Studies of the reaction pathways by rising the methods of quantum chemistry suggest that resistance to penicillin is a road of no return. },

The highest (dry weight) faecal concentrations (IVM: 19.5 mug/g; DRM: 20.5 mug/g; MXD: 16.6 mug/g) were detected at 24 h for all molecules and each compound was detected (greater than or equal to 0.05 mug/g) in faeces between 8 h and 8 days following administration. The avermectins and milbemycin with longer residence times may have extended prophylactic activity in horses and may be more effective against emerging and maturing cyathostomes during therapy.

Here we focus on a small-world network derived from high-throughput (and error-prone) protein-protein interaction experiments. We exploit the neighborhood cohesiveness property of small-world networks to assess confidence for individual protein-protein interactions. By ascertaining how well each protein-protein interaction (edge) fits the pattern of a small-world network, we stratify even those edges with identical experimental evidence. This result promises to improve the quality of inference from protein-protein interaction networks in particular and small-world networks in general. },

Directions of anti-aging research could be significantly influenced by basic theories of aging. Weismann proposed in 1882 that aging was an evolved genetically programmed adaptation that had a species benefit. Since then this idea has been largely replaced by various theories in which aging is not an adaptation but results from accumulated adverse mutations or is an adverse side effect of some essential process. Arguments are presented to the effect that aging is an evolved beneficial characteristic and is therefore likely to result from a more complex and structured mechanism than if it resulted from more random processes such as mutation accumulation. Further, aging appears to be one of a number of related and interactive tife-cycle characteristics including age-at-puberty suggesting that it might be controlled by similar biological mechanisms.

  Abstract                 = {There is a class of theories of aging (variously termed adaptive aging, aging by design, aging selected for its own sake, or programmed death theories) that hold that an organism design that limits life span conveys benefits and was selected specifically because it limits life span. These theories have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity because of the discovery of genes that promote aging in various organisms. However, traditional evolution theory has a core tenet that excludes the possibility of evolving and retaining an individually adverse organism design, i.e. a design characteristic that reduces the ability of individual organisms to survive or reproduce without any compensating individual benefit. Various theories of aging dating from the 1950s and based on traditional evolution theory enjoy substantial popularity. Therefore. any theorist proposing an adaptive theory of aging must necessarily also propose some adjustment to traditional evolution theory that specifically addresses the individual benefit issue. This paper describes an adaptive theory of aging and describes how one of the proposed adjustments (evolvability theory) supports adaptive aging. This issue is important because adaptive theories are generally more optimistic regarding prospects for medical intervention in the aging process and also suggest different approaches in achieving such intervention.

Perhaps as a consequence, the activity of these proteins is exquisitely regulated.

We report here that the highly purified UmuD protein is specifically degraded \emph{in vitro} by Lon in an ATP-dependent manner. To identify the regions of UmuD necessary for Lon-mediated proteolysis, we performed 'alanine-stretch' mutagenesis on umuD and followed the stability of the mutant protein \emph{in vivo}. Such an approach allowed us to localize the site(s) within UmuD responsible for Lon-mediated proteolysis. The primary signal is located between residues 15 and 18 (FPLF), with an auxiliary site between residues 26 and 29 (FPSP), of the amino terminus of UmuD. Transfer of the amino terminus of UmuD (residues 1-40) to an otherwise stable protein imparts Lon-mediated proteolysis, thereby indicating that the amino terminus of UmuD is sufficient for Lon recognition and the ensuing degradation of the protein.},

  Abstract                 = {A general route for protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells has been proposed and applied to monoclonal antibody (MAb) synthesis. It takes into account transcription of the gene, binding of ribosomes to {mRNA}, and polypeptide elongation including binding to SRP (signal recognition particles) and SRP-receptor, competing translocation, folding and glycosylation, assembly of the heavy and light chains in a tetrameric protein and Golgi processing and secretion. A comprehensive mode], was built on the basis of the proposed pathway. The model takes into account the mechanism of each step. Metabolic control analysis (MCA) principles were applied to the general pathway using the proposed model, and control coefficients were calculated. The results show a shared flux control (of both pathway flux and flux ratio at the branch) among different steps, i.e., transcription, folding, glycosylation, translocation and building blocks synthesis. The steps sharing the control depend on the concentration of building blocks, pathway flux and levels of OST (oligosacharyl transferase), BiP (heavy chain binding protein) and PDI (protein disulfide isomerase). Model predictions compare well with experimental data for MAb synthesis, explaining the control structure of the route and the heterogeneity of the product and also addressing future targets for improvement of the production rate of MAbs. }

The number of {tRNA} genes are between 170 and 570 and the number of {tRNA} isoacceptors range from 41 to 55. Unexpectedly, the number of {tRNA} genes having the same anticodon but different sequences elsewhere in the {tRNA} body (defined here as {tRNA} isodecoder genes) varies significantly (10-246). {tRNA} isodecoder genes allow up to 274 different {tRNA} species to be produced from 446 genes in humans, but only up to 51 from 275 genes in the budding yeast. The fraction of {tRNA} isodecoder genes among all {tRNA} genes increases across the phylogenetic spectrum. A large number of sequence differences in human {tRNA} isodecoder genes occurs in the internal promoter regions for {RNA} polymerase III. We also describe a systematic, ligation-based method to detect and quantify {tRNA} isodecoder molecules in human samples, and show differential expression of three {tRNA} isodecoders in six human tissues. The large number of {tRNA} isodecoder genes in eukaryotes suggests that {tRNA} function may be more diverse than previously appreciated.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive accounts of modern low human fertility argue that small family size maximizes the inheritance of socioeconomic resources across generations and may consequently increase long-term fitness. This study explores the long-term impacts of fertility and socioeconomic position (SEP) on multiple dimensions of descendant success in a unique Swedish cohort of 14 000 individuals born during 1915-1929. We show that low fertility and high SEP predict increased descendant socioeconomic success across four generations. Furthermore, these effects are multiplicative, with the greatest benefits of low fertility observed when SEP is high. Low fertility and high SEP do not, however, predict increased descendant reproductive success. Our results are therefore consistent with the idea that modern fertility limitation represents a strategic response to the local costs of rearing socioeconomically competitive offspring, but contradict adaptive models suggesting that it maximizes long-term fitness. This indicates a conflict in modern societies between behaviours promoting socioeconomic versus biological success. This study also makes a methodological contribution, demonstrating that the number of offspring strongly predicts long-term fitness and thereby validating use of fertility data to estimate current selective pressures in modern populations. Finally, our findings highlight that differences in fertility and SEP can have important long-term effects on the persistence of social inequalities across generations.},

  Abstract                 = {The human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) is encoded by exons 2-10 of the hGHR gene on chromosome 5p13.1-p12. There are several different 5' Untranslated region (5'UTR) variants of hGHR {mRNA} that all encode the same protein. We have recently mapped the V1-V9 5'UTR sequences within 40kb of the 5' flanking region of the hGHR gene. Seven of the exons are clustered within two small modules, module A (V2-V9-V3) and module B (V7-V1-V4-V8), similar to 38 kb and similar to 18 kb respectively upstream of exon 2 of the coding region; V6 lies midway between the two modules and V5 is adjacent to exon 2. We now report the existence of two subvariant V3 exons, one upstream of module A (exon V3b) and one midway between module B and exon 2 (exon V3a/b). Both have sequences homologous to Alu elements. In addition, we determined the alternative splicing mechanisms that produce three different {mRNA}s from these exons: V3c (from the V3 exon in module A) or V3a and V3b (from a combination of exon V3 and the Alu-containing V3 subvariant exons). hGHR expression is under developmentaland tissue-specific regulation: module A-derived {mRNA}s are widely expressed in human tissues, while module B-derived {mRNA}s are only detectable in postnatal liver. Expression of the variant V3 {mRNA}s is similar to those from module A, being produced ubiquitously in human fetal and postnatal tissues, with V3c always the major variant detected. The Alu-containing {mRNA}s (V3a and V3b) are also detectable in baboon and rhesus tissues, in accordance with the finding of Alu elements throughout the primate genome. In summary, we have mapped the relative locations of two new 5'UTR exons within the 5' flanking region of the hGHR gene and described the derivation and expression patterns for two variant hGHR {mRNA}s from these primate-specific exons. The introduction of Alu elements has contributed to the evolution of the primate GHR gene as a highly complex transcriptional unit. }

Hotspots: comm. in which interacting spp. have reciprocal effects on fitness and are embedded in areas in which there is selection on only one or none of the species (cold spots). I'm not clear what all the fuss is. The basic model assumes that allele fitness of species $x$ is a function of allele freq of species $y$ in both hot and cold spots. Species $y$ fitness, however, is only of function of species $x$ in hot spots (it's constant otherwise). Spatially implicit in only the most rudimentory sense. There are essentially two patches. Explore different amounts of gene flow and under both soft selection (local regulation of density within a patch, independent of selection) and hard selection (proportion of adults emerging from a spot is a function of selection and total population regulation occurs globally). Assume positive freq. dependent selection, i.e. fitness of an allele increases or decreases linearly with frequency of the allele of the other species. Isolated spots: no gene flow from h to c or c to h. Five possible equilibria. Four corner and one internal which is always unstable. The stability of the corners depends on the sign of the interaction. Hot spots: If the interaction is antagonistic then "mismatched alleles" are stable. If the interaction is cooperative then matche alleles become fixed. Victim-exploiter is unstable, but eventually becomes fixed arbitrarily for finite systems. Uniform mixing: Variation in habitats, but gene frequency across entire system is looked at since there is uniform mixing (i.e. prob. of offspring going to hot or cold spot is independent of origin and is simply proportional to fraction of habitat which is hot or cold). Hard Selection: okay. there's really nothing that profound in all of this. There are, however, some cool graphs (check out Fig 7).}

We studied three 'resource unit restricted fungi' colonizing Pinus sylvestris needles along a climatic gradient. We investigated both competition and succession. A general linear model was used for statistical analysis. Despite interference competition at the scale of the individual needle, the first two colonizers, Lophodermium pinastri and Cyclaneusma minus, coexisted and the frequencies of both increased with altitude. This increase seemed to be related to the greater humidity at altitude. The initial stages of development of the final colonizer, Verticicladium. trifidum, were strongly dependent on the first two colonizers on the individual needles. The observed decrease in frequency of V. trifidum with increasing altitude may be due to interactions with the early colonizers, with no direct effect of altitude on V. trifidum. Fungal colonization at low and high altitudes can be interpreted by accounting for both climatic effects and fungal interactions expressed as interference and succession. }

  Abstract                 = {We aimed to provide a theoretical framework for dynamic studies of competition between fungi living on divided and ephemeral resources. We previously adapted the seminal Skellam's patch-occupancy model (Skellam, 1951) to describe the population dynamics of one species of unit-restricted fungus whose mycelial growth occurs within resource units and which colonizes new resource units by spore dispersal (Gourbiere et al., 1999). In this study, we extended this model to describe the competition between a pair of unit-restricted fungal species that interact. with each other inside units by decreasing their spore production. Accordingly, we designed a discrete-time metapopulation model where all patches go extinct at each generation and species interact by lowering their propagule production in jointly occupied patches. We showed that the two species easily coexist although there is no trade-off between their competitive and colonization abilities. Furthermore, the outcome of the competition process can depend on a founder effect. Founder effect determines either which species is excluded or the relative densities of each species when they coexist. We investigated the implications of these results on the distribution and abundance of fungal species along environmental gradients. This work bridges the gap between the mycological theory of "Resource Units" and the metapopulation theory, showing the specificity of fungal exploitation competition. We suggest that unit-restricted fungal species are appropriate biological models to test the theoretical results of the metapopulation theory, such as the appearance of alternative stable equilibria.

  Abstract                 = {A recent slew of ENCODE Consortium publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80\% of the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is under 10\%. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 − 10 = 70\% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these 'functional” regions, or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly (1) by employing the seldom used 'causal role” definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, (2) by committing a logical fallacy known as 'affirming the consequent,” (3) by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between 'junk DNA” and 'garbage DNA,” (4) by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, (5) by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and (6) by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe an age-structured mathematical model of the malaria parasite life cycle that uses clinical observations of peripheral parasitaemia to estimate population dynamics of sequestered parasites, which are hidden from the clinical investigator. First, the model was tested on parasite populations cultured \emph{in vitro}, and was found to account for similar to72\% of the variation in that sub-population of parasites that would have been sequestered \emph{in vivo}. Next, the model was applied to patients undergoing antimalarial therapy. Using individual data sets we found that although the model fitted the peripheral parasite curves very well, unique solutions for the fit could not be obtained; therefore, robust estimates of sequestered parasite dynamics remained unavailable. We conclude that even given detailed data on individual parasitaemia, estimates of sequestered numbers may be difficult to obtain. However, if data on individuals undergoing similar therapy are collected at equal time intervals, some of these problems may be overcome by estimating specific parameters over groups of patients. In this manner we estimated sequestered parasite density in a group of patients sampled at identical time points following antimalarial treatment. Using this approach we found significant relationships between changes in parasite density, age structure and temperature that were not apparent from the analysis of peripheral parasitaemia only.

We used lexical data and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to construct a phylogeny of 400 languages. In agreement with the pulse-pause scenario, the language trees place the Austronesian origin in Taiwan approximately 5230 years ago and reveal a series of settlement pauses and expansion pulses linked to technological and social innovations. These results are robust to assumptions about the rooting and calibration of the trees and demonstrate the combined power of linguistic scholarship, database technologies, and computational phylogenetic methods for resolving questions about human prehistory.},

This finding strongly suggests that P-element ends from different chromosomes become associated, followed by ''pseudo-excision,'' We show that two different processes are in involved in resolving the pseudo-excision event: (1) the excised P-element ends continue to function as a single unit (Hybrid Element) and insert at a nearby site in the chromosome or into the element itself [Hybrid Element Insertion (HEI)] and (2) free ends that do not contain Pelements repair and rejoin [(Hybrid Excision and Repair (HER)]. Both types of resolution can lead to recombination, and this paper concentrates on the HEI class. One type of HEI event predicts the exact reverse complementary duplication of an 8-bp target site, and we have confirmed the existence of such a structure in six independently derived recombinant chromosomes. There is also a high tendency for insertion events to occur within a few bases of the original 8-bp target site, including six apparent cases of insertion into the exact site. }

Most explanations of hybrid sterility require either genetic incompatibilities between nascent species or gross physical imbalances between their chromosomes, such as rearrangements or ploidy changes. An alternative possibility is that genomes become incompatible at a molecular level, dependent on interactions between primary DNA sequences. The mismatch repair system has previously been shown to contribute to sterility in a hybrid between established yeast species by preventing successful meiotic crossing-over leading to aneuploidy. This system could also promote or reinforce the formation of new species in a similar manner, by making diverging genomes incompatible in meiosis. To test this possibility we crossed yeast strains of the same species but from diverse historical or geographic sources. We show that these crosses are partially sterile and present evidence that the mismatch repair system is largely responsible for this sterility. },

We propose that childhood microparasitic infections, notably measles. provide an unusually suitable empirical and theoretical test bed for addressing these issues. We base our analysis on a new mechanistic time series model for measles, the TSIR model. which captures the mechanistic essence of epidemic dynamics. The model, and parameter estimates based on short-term fits to prevaccination measles time series for 60 towns and cities in England and Wales, is introduced in a companion paper. Here. we explore how well the model predicts the long-term dynamics of measles and the balance between noise and determinism, as a function of population size. The TSIR model captures the basic dynamical features of the long-term pattern of measles epidemics in large cities remarkably well (based on time and frequency domain analyses). In particular, the model illustrates the impact of secular increases in birth rates, which cause a transition from biennial to annual dynamics. The model also captures the observed increase in epidemic irregularity with decreasing population size and the onset of local extinction below a critical community size. Decreased host population size is shown to be associated with an increased impact of demographic stochasticity. The interaction between nonlinearity and noise is explored using local Lyapunov exponents (LLE). These testify to the high level of stability of the biennial attractor in large cities. Irregularities are due to the limit cycle evolving with changing human birth rates and not due to complex dynamics. The geometry of the dynamics (sign and magnitude of the LLEs across phase space) is similar in the cities and the smaller urban areas. The qualitative difference in dynamics between small and large host communities is that demographic and extinction-recolonization stochasticities are much more influential in the former. The regional dynamics can therefore only be understood in terms of a core-satellite metapopulation structure for this host-enemy system. We also make a preliminary exploration of the model's ability to predict the dynamic consequences of measles vaccination.},

Here we address this issue by using time series from sheep populations on two islands in the St Kilda archipelago(11-13). Fluctuations in the sizes of the two populations are remarkably synchronized over a 40-year period, A nonlinear time-series model shows that a high and frequent degree of environmental correlation is required to achieve this level of synchrony. The model indicates that if there were less environmental correlation, population dynamics would be much less synchronous than is observed. This is because of a threshold effect that is dependent on population size; the threshold magnifies random differences between populations. A refined model shows that part of the required environmental synchronicity can be accounted for by large-scale weather variations. These results underline the importance of understanding the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic influences on population dynamics(14). },

  Abstract                 = {What defines the genetic map? The specification of meiotic recombination sites During meiosis, homologous reciprocal recombination events or crossing-over determine the genetic map and are known not to be randomly distributed in the genome. Recent studies in yeasts and mammals reveal some key features of the molecular mechanism involved in this distribution. Through different molecular processes, specific histone post-translational modifications are induced at specific genomic sites, called hotspots, where initiation of meiotic recombination takes place. These sites are some transcription promoters in S. cerevisiae or binding sites for transcription factors in S. pombe, where chromatin modifiers are recruited. In mammals, the sites are DNA sequences recognized by the PRDM9 protein which has the ability both to bind DNA and to induce the trimethylation of the lysine 4 of histone H3. The properties of the chromatin at these sites, and potentially the binding of additional factors, allow the recruitment of proteins involved in the formation of DNA double strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination.},

  Abstract                 = {Using DNA microarrays, we compared global transcript stability profiles following chemical inhibition of transcription to rpb1-1 (a temperature-sensitive allele of yeast {RNA} polymerase II). Among the five inhibitors tested, the effects of thiolutin and 1,10-phenanthroline were most similar to rpb1-1. A comparison to various microarray data already in the literature revealed similarity between {mRNA} stability profiles and the transcriptional response to stresses such as heat shock, consistent with the fact that the general stress response includes a transient shutoff of general {mRNA} transcription. Genes encoding factors involved in rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly, which are often observed to be coordinately down-regulated in yeast microarray data, were among the least stable transcripts. We examined the effects of deletions of genes encoding deadenylase components Ccr4p and Pan2p and putative {RNA}-binding proteins Pub1p and Puf4p on the genome-wide pattern of {mRNA} stability after inhibition of transcription by chemicals and/or heat stress. This examination showed that Ccr4p, the major yeast {mRNA} deadenylase, contributes to the degradation of transcripts encoding both ribosomal proteins and rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly factors and mediates a large part of the transcriptional response to heat stress. Pan2p and Puf4p also contributed to the degradation rate of these mRNAs following transcriptional shutoff, while Pub1p preferentially stabilized transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins. Our results indicate that the abundance of ribosome biogenesis factors is controlled at the level of {mRNA} stability.},

Aand U-ending codons predominate. as expected in an A + T-rich genome. Two trends of codon usage variation among genes were identified using correspondence analysis. The primary trend is in the extent of usage of a subset of presumably translationally optimal codons. that are used at significantly higher frequencies in genes expected to be expressed at high levels. Fifteen of the 18 codons identified as optimal are more G + C-rich than the otherwise common codons. so that codon selection associated with translation opposes the general mutation bias, Among 40 genes with lower frequencies of these optimal codons, a secondary trend in G + C content was identified. In these genes, G + C content at synonymously variable third positions of codons is correlated with that in 5' and 3' flanking sequences, indicative of regional variation in G + C content, perhaps reflecting regional variation in mutational biases.

Here we report the kinetic analysis of selection taking place under conditions where the overall selectivity was close to values observed in vivo and initial selection and proofreading contributed about equally. Comparison of the rate constants shows that the 350-fold difference in stabilities of cognate and near-cognate codon-anticodon complexes is not used for tRNA selection due to high rate of GTP hydrolysis in the cognate complex. tRNA selection at the initial selection step is entirely kinetically controlled and is due to much faster (650-fold) GTP hydrolysis of cognate compared to near-cognate substrate.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Transposon-derived Alu repeats are exclusively associated with primate genomes. They have gained considerable importance in the recent times with evidence of their involvement in various aspects of gene regulation, e.g. alternative splicing, nucleosome positioning, CpG methylation, binding sites for transcription factors and hormone receptors, etc. The objective of this study is to investigate the factors that influence the distribution of Alu repeat elements in the human genome. Such analysis is expected to yield insights into various aspects of gene regulation in primates. Results: Analysis of Alu repeat distribution for the human genome build 32 (released in January 2003) reveals that they occupy nearly one-tenth portion of the sequenced regions. Huge variations in Alu frequencies were seen across the genome with chromosome 19 being the most and chromosome Y being the least Alu dense chromosomes. The highlights of the analysis are as follows: (1) three-fourth of the total genes in the genome are associated with Alus. (2) Alu density is higher in genes as compared with intergenic regions in all the chromosomes except 19 and 22. (3) Alu density in human genome is highly correlated with GC content, gene density and intron density with GC content being major deterministic factor compared with other two. (4) Alu densities were correlated more with gene density than intron density indicating the insertion of Alus in untranslated regions of exons.

  Abstract                 = {Synonymous codons are widely selected for various biological mechanisms in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Recent evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA) function may affect synonymous codon choices near miRNA target sites. To better understand this, we perform genome-wide analysis on synonymous codon usage around miRNA target sites in four plant genomes. We observed a general trend of increased site accessibility around miRNA target sites in plants. Guanine-cytosine (GC)-poor codons are preferred in the flank region of miRNA target sites. Within-genome analyses show significant variation among miRNA targets in species. GC content of the target gene can partly explain the variation of site accessibility among miRNA targets. miRNA targets in GC-rich genes show stronger selection signals than those in GC-poor genes. Gene's codon usage bias and the conservation level of miRNA and its target also have some effects on site accessibility, but the expression level of miRNA or its target and the mechanism of miRNA activity do not contribute to site accessibility differences among miRNA targets. We suggest that synonymous codons near miRNA targets are selected for efficient miRNA binding and proper miRNA function. Our results present a new dimension of natural selection on synonymous codons near miRNA target sites in plants, which will have important implications of coding sequence evolution.},

In this paper, 563 Homo sapiens genes and 417 \emph{Escherichia coli} genes coding for proteins with four different folding types have been analyzed using variance analysis, a multivariate analysis method newly used in codon usage analysis, to find the correlation between amino acid composition, synonymous codon, and protein structure in different organisms. It has been found that in E. coli, both amino acid compositions in differently folded proteins and synonymous codon usage in different gene classes coding for differently folded proteins are significantly different. It was also found that only amino acid composition is different in different protein classes in H. sapiens. There is no universal correlation between synonymous codon usage and protein structure in these two different organisms. Further analysis has shown that GC content on the second codon position can distinguish coding genes for different folded proteins in both organisms. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Moreover, I have studied the inverse relationship between the evolutionary rate and the effective population size, showing that the number of molecular phenotypes of protein function, i.e., independent components in the fitness of the organism, may play a key role for the molecular clock under the nearly-neutral theory. These results are helpful for having a better understanding of the underlying evolutionary mechanism of protein sequences, as well as human disease-related mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we develop an evolutionary model for protein sequence evolution. Gene pleiotropy is characterized by K distinct but correlated components (molecular phenotypes) that affect the organismal fitness. These K molecular phenotypes are under stabilizing selection with microadaptation (SM) due to random optima shifts, the SM model. Random coding mutations generate a correlated distribution of K molecular phenotypes. Under this SM model, we further develop a statistical method to estimate the "effective" number of molecular phenotypes (K(e)) of the gene. Therefore, for the first time we can empirically evaluate gene pleiotropy from the protein sequence analysis. Case studies of vertebrate proteins indicate that K(e) is typically approximately 6-9. We demonstrate that the newly developed SM model of protein evolution may provide a basis for exploring genomic evolution and correlations.},

  Abstract                 = {To maintain normal physiological functions, different tissues may have different developmental constraints on expressed genes. Consequently, the evolutionary tolerance for genomic evolution varies among tissues. Here, we formulate this argument as a "tissue-driven hypothesis" based on the stabilizing selection model. Moreover, several predicted genomic correlations are tested by the human-mouse microarray data. Our results are as follows. First, between the human and mouse, we have elaborated the among-tissue covariation between tissue expression distance (E(ti)) and tissue sequence distance (D(ti)). This highly significant E(ti) - D(ti) correlation emerges when the expression divergence and protein sequence divergence are under the same tissue constraints. Second, the tissue-driven hypothesis further explains the observed significant correlation between the tissue expression distance (between the human and mouse) and the duplicate tissue distance (T(dup)) between human (or mouse) paralogous genes. In other words, between-duplicate and interspecies expression divergences covary among tissues. Third, for genes with the same expression broadness, we found that genes expressed in more stringent tissues (e.g., neurorelated) generally tend to evolve more slowly than those in more relaxed tissues (e.g., hormone-related). We conclude that tissue factors should be considered as an important component in shaping the pattern of genomic evolution and correlations.},

  Abstract                 = {Deleting a gene in an organism often has little phenotypic effect(1-5), owing to two mechanisms of compensation(4-10). The first is the existence of duplicate genes: that is, the loss of function in one copy can be compensated by the other copy or copies. The second mechanism of compensation stems from alternative metabolic pathways, regulatory networks, and so on. The relative importance of the two mechanisms has not been investigated except for a limited study, which suggested that the role of duplicate genes in compensation is negligible(10). The availability of fitness data for a nearly complete set of single-gene-deletion mutants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome(11) has enabled us to carry out a genome-wide evaluation of the role of duplicate genes in genetic robustness against null mutations. Here we show that there is a significantly higher probability of functional compensation for a duplicate gene than for a singleton, a high correlation between the frequency of compensation and the sequence similarity of two duplicates, and a higher probability of a severe fitness effect when the duplicate copy that is more highly expressed is deleted. We estimate that in S. cerevisiae at least a quarter of those gene deletions that have no phenotype are compensated by duplicate genes. },

  Abstract                 = {During meiosis, recombination between homologous chromosomes generates crossover (CR) and noncrossover (NCR) products. CRs establish connections between homologs, whereas intermediates leading to NCRs have been proposed to participate in homologous pairing. How these events are differentiated and regulated remains to be determined. We have developed a strategy to detect, quantify, and map NCRs in parallel to CRs, at the Psmb9 melotic recombination hot spot, in male and female mouse germ lines. Our results report direct molecular evidence for distinct CR and NCR pathways of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in mouse meiosis based on three observations: both CRs and NCRs require Spo11, NCR products have shorter conversion tracts than CRs, and only CRs require the MutL homolog Mlh1. We show that both products are formed from middle to late pachytene of meiotic prophase and provide evidence for an Mlh1-independent CR pathway, where mismatch repair does not require Mih1. },

  Abstract                 = {A tridimensional allometric model of self-thinning was tested in a tunicate population of Pyura praeputialis in the Antofagasta Bay. northern Chile. The theory tested follows the bidimensional allometric theory of Osawa and Allen for the self-thinning rule proposed for plants. except that in addition to mean individual mass we included three new concepts: the number of layers (an equivalent of the leaf area index, [LAI] used in plants). the effective unit area, and the density per unit effective area. We assumed constant tunicate mass per effective unit area and allometry for mean dimensions of the population. The tridimensional model can be reduced to a bidimensional one if density is expressed as the density per unit effective area, which corresponds to the number of individuals relative to the effective area occupied by individuals when they conform a monolayer. The model allows for random sampling and rules out the selection for samples or stands at maximum crowding. The self-thinning of P. praeputialis through a tridimensional model showed an exponent of -1.518 (95\% CI, -1.635 to -1.401) for mean tunicate visceral mass, and an exponent of -1.489 (95\% CI, -1.588 to -1.390) for the corrected bidimensional model. The two exponents were identical to those predicted from tridimensional allometric theory. The results of this new approach increase the variance explained in comparison to that of classical bidimensional models. },

  Abstract                 = {Mutagenesis of protein-encoding sequences occurs ubiquitously; it enables evolution, accumulates during aging, and is associated with disease. Many biotechnological methods exploit random mutations to evolve novel proteins. To quantitate protein tolerance to random change, it is vital to understand the probability that a random amino acid replacement will lead to a protein's functional inactivation. We define this probability as the "x factor." Here, we develop a broadly applicable approach to calculate x factors and demonstrate this method using the human DNA repair enzyme 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG). Three gene-wide mutagenesis libraries were created, each with 105 diversity and averaging 2.2, 4.6, and 6.2 random amino acid changes per mutant. After determining the percentage of functional mutants in each library using high-stringency selection (>19,000-fold), the x factor was found to be 34\% +/- 6\%. Remarkably, reanalysis of data from studies of diverse proteins reveals similar inactivation probabilities. To delineate the nature of tolerated amino acid substitutions, we sequenced 244 surviving AAG mutants. The 920 tolerated substitutions were characterized by substitutability index and mapped onto the AAG primary, secondary, and known tertiary structures. Evolutionarily conserved residues show low substitutability indices. In AAG, 0 strands are on average less substitutable than alpha helices; and surface loops that are not involved in DNA binding are the most substitutable. Our results are relevant to such diverse topics as applied molecular evolution, the rate of introduction of deleterious alleles into genomes in evolutionary history, and organisms' tolerance of mutational burden.},

Redesign strategies are discussed here, including modification of translation initiation regions, alteration of mRNA structural elements and use of different codon biases. },

We show here that infection of cells with poliovirus results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of a variety of shuttling and non-shuttling nuclear proteins that use multiple nuclear import pathways. In vitro nuclear import assays using semi-permeabilized infected cells confirmed that nuclear import was blocked and demonstrated that docking of nuclear import receptor-cargo complexes at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) was prevented. Analysis of components of the NPC revealed that two proteins, Nup153 and p62, were proteolyzed during poliovirus infection. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic relocalization of numerous cellular proteins is caused by the inhibition of multiple nuclear import pathways via alterations in NPC composition in poliovirus-infected cells. Blocking of nuclear import points to a novel strategy by which cytoplasmic RNA viruses can evade host immune defenses, by preventing signal transduction to the nucleus.},

We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data, searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data. We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence for recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we hope that future sequencing projects will offer more insights into the history of both our own species and others.</p>

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of molecules, developmental circuits, and new species are all characterized by the accumulation of incompatibilities between ancestors and descendants. When specific interactions between components are necessary at any of these levels, this requires compensatory coevolution. Theoretical treatments of compensatory evolution that only consider the endpoints predict that it should be rare because intermediate states are deleterious. However, empirical data suggest that compensatory evolution is common at all levels of molecular interaction. A general solution to this paradox is provided by plausible neutral or nearly neutral intermediates that possess informational redundancy. These intermediates provide an evolutionary path between coadapted allelic combinations. Although they allow incompatible end points to evolve, at no point was a deleterious mutation ever in need of compensation. As a result, what appears to be compensatory evolution may often actually be "pseudocompensatory." Both theoretical and empirical studies indicate that pseudocompensation can speed the evolution of intergenic incompatibility, especially when driven by adaptation. However, under strong stabilizing selection the rate of pseudocompensatory evolution is still significant. Important examples of this process at work discussed here include the evolution of rRNA secondary structures, intraand inter-protein interactions, and developmental genetic pathways. Future empirical work in this area should focus on comparing the details of intra- and intergenic interactions in closely related organisms. }

Image analysis and in situ hybridization were combined to show that in the presymptomatic stages of infection there is a large, relatively stable pool of virions on the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells and a smaller pool of productively infected cells. Despite evidence of constraints on HIV-1 replication in the infected cell population in lymphoid tissues, estimates of the numbers of these cells and the virus they could produce are consistent with the quantities of virus that have been detected in the bloodstream. The cellular Sources of virus production and storage in lymphoid tissues can now be studied with this approach over the course of infection and treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {Determining the evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance of gene duplicates is key to understanding the processes leading to evolutionary adaptation and novelty. In his highly prescient book, Susumu Ohno recognized that duplicate genes are fixed and maintained within a population with 3 distinct outcomes: neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, and conservation of function. Subsequent researchers have proposed a multitude of population genetic models that lead to these outcomes, each differing largely in the role played by adaptive natural selection. In this paper, I present a nonmathematical review of these models, their predictions, and the evidence collected in support of each of them. Though the various outcomes of gene duplication are often strictly associated with the presence or absence of adaptive natural selection, I argue that determining the outcome of duplication is orthogonal to determining whether natural selection has acted. Despite an ever-growing field of research into the fate of gene duplicates, there is not yet clear evidence for the preponderance of one outcome over the others, much less evidence for the importance of adaptive or nonadaptive forces in maintaining these duplicates.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim is to review findings related to the use of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, focusing on its limitations and benefits in controlling tuberculosis (TB). Some new TB vaccines, which have entered or are expected to enter clinical trials, are highlighted. RECENT FINDINGS: BCG is currently the only available vaccine against TB, and is widely administered within the World Health Organization Expanded Programme for Immunization. Several trials have shown that the protective efficacy of BCG varies between different populations. Recently, a 60-year follow-up study of American Indians reported the long-term efficacy of BCG to be 52\%. The reasons for the low efficacy of the BCG vaccine may be generic differences in the BCG strains, differences in immunological properties of study populations or exposure to environmental factors such as mycobacteria. The low efficacy of the BCG vaccine has encouraged the search for a new vaccine. Among new vaccine candidates are live attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccines, recombinant BCG, DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines and fusion proteins with novel adjuvants and delivery systems. SUMMARY: Today, most of the world's population is vaccinated with BCG. It is generally accepted that BCG protects against childhood TB but this immunity wanes with age, resulting in no or insufficient protection against TB. Using modern techniques, several research groups have developed more than 200 new vaccine candidates. Some of these vaccines are now in clinical trials. The clinical evaluation of these new vaccines should be designed to cover a heterogeneous population with great variation in immune responses.},

With the growing amount of genome sequence data, there is a demand for a flexible and easy-to-maintain structure for storing sequence data and results from bioinformatic analysis. More than 150 sequenced bacterial genomes are now available, and comparisons of properties for taxonomically similar organisms are not readily available to many biologists. In addition to the most basic information, such as AT content, chromosome length, {tRNA} count and rRNA count, a large number of more complex calculations are needed to perform detailed comparative genomics. DNA structural calculations like curvature and stacking energy, DNA compositions like base skews, oligo skews and repeats at the local and global level are just a few of the analysis that are presented on the CBS Genome Atlas Web page. Complex analysis, changing methods and frequent addition of new models are factors that require a dynamic database layout. Using basic tools like the GNU Make system, csh, Perl and MySQL, we have created a flexible database environment for storing and maintaining such results for a collection of complete microbial genomes. Currently, these results counts to more than 220 pieces of information. The backbone of this solution consists of a program package written in Perl, which enables administrators to synchronize and update the database content. The MySQL database has been connected to the CBS web-server via PHP4, to present a dynamic web content for users outside the center. This solution is tightly fitted to existing server infrastructure and the solutions proposed here can perhaps serve as a template for other research groups to solve database issues. }

Current modeling of selection via site-to-site rate heterogeneity generally neglects another aspect of selection, namely position-specific amino acid frequencies. These frequencies determine the maximum dissimilarity expected for highly diverged but functionally and structurally conserved sequences, and hence are crucial for estimating long distances. We introduce a codon-level model of coding sequence evolution in which position-specific amino acid frequencies are free parameters. In our implementation, these are estimated from an alignment using methods described previously. We use simulations to demonstrate the importance and feasibility of modeling such behavior; our model produces linear distance estimates over a wide range of distances, while several alternative models underestimate long distances relative to short distances. Site-to-site differences in rates, as well as synonymous/nonsynonymous and first/second/third-codon-position differences, arise as a natural consequence of the site-to-site differences in amino acid frequencies.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models are utilized to approximate various highly complex engineering, physical, environmental, social, and economic phenomena. Model parameters exerting the most influence on model results are identified through a 'sensitivity analysis'. A comprehensive review is presented of more than a dozen sensitivity analysis methods. This review is intended for those not intimately familiar with statistics or the techniques utilized for sensitivity analysis of computer models. The most fundamental of sensitivity techniques utilizes partial differentiation whereas the simplest approach requires varying parameter values one-at-a-time. Correlation analysis is used to determine relationships between independent and dependent variables. Regression analysis provides the most comprehensive sensitivity measure and is commonly utilized to build response surfaces that approximate complex models.},

The \emph{Escherichia coli} proteome has been extensively studied and is well defined in terms of biochemical, biological, and biotechnological data. Even before the entire E. coli proteome was fully elucidated, the largest available data set had been integrated to decipher regulatory circuits and metabolic pathways, providing valuable insights into global cellular physiology and the development of metabolic and cellular engineering strategies. With the recent advent of advanced proteomic technologies, the E. coli proteome has been used for the validation of new technologies and methodologies such as sample prefractionation, protein enrichment, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, protein detection, mass spectrometry (MS), combinatorial assays with n-dimensional chromatographies and MS, and image analysis software. These important technologies will not only provide a great amount of additional information on the E. coli proteome but also synergistically contribute to other proteomic studies. Here, we review the past development and current status of E. coli proteome research in terms of its biological, biotechnological, and methodological significance and suggest future prospects. },

Using a model of gonorrhea transmission dynamics, we obtain generally applicable, qualitative results that show how compensatory mutations lead to more likely and faster resistance emergence. We further show that resistance emergence depends on the level of drug use in a strongly nonlinear fashion. We also discuss what data need to be obtained to allow future quantitative predictions of resistance emergence. }

The method applied to batch-cultures of S. cerevisiae on glucose revealed complex dynamics in intracellular amino acid pools. The most drastic changes were observed during the diauxic shift and at the entry into the stationary phase. Even during phases of exponential growth on glucose and ethanol, cells showed significant variations in intracellular amino acid concentrations.

Recent systems biology tools have significantly shortened the time required to proceed from a mapped locus to testing of candidate genes. These tools enable research on natural variation to move from simple reductionistic studies focused on individual genes to integrative studies connecting molecular variation at multiple loci with physiological consequences. This review focuses on recent examples that demonstrate how expression QTL data can be used for gene discovery and exploited to untangle complex regulatory networks. },

The ability of a ribosome to decode mRNA without shifting between reading frames is a strict requirement for accurate protein biosynthesis. Despite enormous progress in understanding the mechanism of transfer RNA selection, the mechanism by which the correct reading frame is maintained remains unclear. In this report, evidence is presented that supports the idea that the translational frame is controlled mainly by the stability of codon - anticodon interactions at the P site. The relative instability of such interactions may lead to dissociation of the P-site tRNA from its codon, and formation of a complex with an overlapping codon, the process known as P-site tRNA slippage. We propose that this process is central to all known cases of +1 ribosomal frameshifting, including that required for the decoding of the yeast transposable element Ty3. An earlier model for the decoding of this element proposed 'out-of-frame' binding of A-site tRNA without preceding P-site tRNA slippage. },

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of natural populations are thought to be dominated by demographic and environmental processes with little influence of intraspecific genetic variation and natural selection, apart from inbreeding depression possibly reducing population growth in small populations. Here we analyse hundreds of well-characterised local populations in a large metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia), which persists in a balance between stochastic local extinctions and recolonisations in a network of 4,000 discrete habitat patches. We show that the allelic composition of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) has a significant effect on the growth of local populations, consistent with previously reported effects of allelic variation on flight metabolic performance and fecundity in the Glanville fritillary and Colias butterflies. The strength and the sign of the molecular effect on population growth are sensitive to the ecological context (the area and spatial connectivity of the habitat patches), which affects genotype-specific gene flow and the influence of migration on the dynamics of local populations. The biological significance of the results for Pgi is underscored by lack of any association between population growth and allelic variation at six other loci typed in the same material. In demonstrating, to our knowledge for the first time, that molecular variation in a candidate gene affects population growth, this study challenges the perception that differential performance of individual genotypes, leading to differential fitness, is irrelevant to population dynamics. These results also demonstrate that the spatial configuration of habitat and spatial dynamics of populations contribute to maintenance of Pgi polymorphism in this species. },

  Abstract                 = {If the transmission occurs through local contact of the individuals in a spatially structured population, the evolutionarily stable (ESS) traits of parasite might be quite different from what the classical theory with complete mixing predicts. In this paper, we theoretically study the ESS virulence and transmission rate of a parasite in a lattice-structured host population, in which the host can send progeny only to its neighboring vacant site, and the transmission occurs only in between the infected and the susceptible in the nearest-neighbor sites. Infected host is assumed to be infertile. the analysis based on the pair approximation and the Monte Carlo simulation reveal that the ESS transmission rate and virulence in a lattice-structured population are greatly reduced from those in completely mixing population. Unlike completely mixing populations, the spread of parasite can drive the host to extinction, because the local density of the susceptible next to the infected can remain high even when the global density of host becomes very low. This demographic viscosity and group selection between self-organized spatial clusters of host individuals then leads to an intermediate ESS transmission rate even if there is no tradeoff between transmission rate and virulence. the ESS transmission rate is below the region of parasite-driven extinction by a finite amount for moderately large reproductive rate of host; whereas, the evolution of transmission rate leads to the fade out of parasite for small reproductive rate, and the extinction of host for very large reproductive rate.

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary biology has tended to focus on adaptive evolution by positive selection as the primum mobile of evolutionary trajectories in species while underestimating the importance of nonadaptive evolutionary processes. In this review, I describe evidence that suggests that primate and human evolution has been strongly influenced by nonadaptive processes, particularly random genetic drift and mutation. This is evidenced by three fundamental effects: a relative relaxation of selective constraints (i.e., purifying selection), a relative increase in the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations, and a general reduction in the efficacy of positive selection. These effects are observed in protein-coding, regulatory regions, and in gene expression data, as well as in an augmentation of fixation of large-scale mutations, including duplicated genes, mobile genetic elements, and nuclear mitochondrial DNA. The evidence suggests a general population-level explanation such as a reduction in effective population size (Ne). This would have tipped the balance between the evolutionary forces of natural selection and random genetic drift toward genetic drift for variants having small selective effects. After describing these proximate effects, I describe the potential consequences of these effects for primate and human evolution. For example, an increase in the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations could potentially have led to an increase in the fixation rate of compensatory mutations that act to suppress the effects of slightly deleterious substitutions. The potential consequences of compensatory evolution for the evolution of novel gene functions and in potentially confounding the detection of positively selected genes are explored. The consequences of the passive accumulation of large-scale genomic mutations by genetic drift are unclear, though evidence suggests that new gene copies as well as insertions of transposable elements into genes can potentially lead to adaptive phenotypes. Finally, because a decrease in selective constraint at the genetic level is expected to have effects at the morphological level, I review studies that compare rates of morphological change in various mammalian and island populations where Ne is reduced. Furthermore, I discuss evidence that suggests that craniofacial morphology in the Homo lineage has shifted from an evolutionary rate constrained by purifying selection toward a neutral evolutionary rate.

  Abstract                 = {The patterns of nonrandom usage of synonymous codons (codon bias) in enteric bacteria were analyzed. Poisson random field (PRF) theory was used to derive the expected distribution of frequencies of nucleotides differing from the ancestral state at aligned sites in a set of DNA sequences. This distribution was applied to synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms and amino acid polymorphisms in the gnd and putP genes of \emph{Escherichia coli}. For the gnd gene, the average intensity of selection against disfavored synonymous codons was estimated as approximately 7.3 X 10(-9); this value is significantly smaller than the estimated selection intensity against selectively disfavored amino acids in observed polymorphisms (2.0 X 10(-8)), but it is approximately of the same order of magnitude. The selection coefficients for optimal synonymous codons estimated from PRF theory were consistent with independent estimates based on codon usage for threonine and glycine. Across 118 genes in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the distribution of estimated selection coefficients, expressed as multiples of the effective population size, has a mean and standard deviation of 0.5 +/- 0.4. No significant differences were found in the degree of codon bias between conserved positions and replacement positions, suggesting that translational misincorporation is not an important selective constraint among synonymous polymorphic codons in enteric bacteria. However, across the first 100 codons of the genes, conserved amino acids with identical codons have significantly greater codon bias than that of either synonymous or nonidentical codons, suggesting that there are unique selective constraints, perhaps including {mRNA} secondary structures, in this part of the coding region.}

Science performance ratings based on the UK National Curriculum were collected from teachers when the twins were 9, 10 and 12 years old. Science excellence was defined as performing above the 85th percentile. Sex-limitation liability threshold models were used to assess sex differences in etiology. Results: We found no evidence for quantitative or qualitative sex differences in the etiology of science excellence, which was moderately heritable (30-50\%), and influenced by both shared (40-56\%) and non-shared (10-13\%) environmental influences. Conclusions: Although boys and girls do not differ genetically in relation to school science performance per se, the under-representation of women in scientific careers may be due to attitudes rather than aptitudes.},

Age-appropriate psychometric cognitive tests were administered to the twins and used to create g scores standardized within each study. Liability-threshold model fitting was used to estimate genetic and environmental parameters for the top 15\% of the distribution of g. Genetic influence for high g was substantial (0.50, with a 95\% confidence interval of 0.41-0.60). Shared environmental influences were moderate (0.28, 0.19-0.37).

  Abstract                 = {Codon usage patterns and phylogenetic relationships in the actin multigene family have been analyzed for three dipteran species-Drosophila melanogaster, Bactrocera dorsalis, and Ceratitis capitata. In certain phylogenetic tree reconstructions, using synonymous distances, some gene relationships are altered due to a homogenization phenomenon. We present evidence to show that this homogenization phenomenon is due to codon usage bias. A survey of the pattern of synonymous codon preferences for 11 actin genes from these three species reveals that five out of the six Drosophila actin genes show high degrees of codon bias as indicated by scaled chi(2) values. In contrast to this, four out of the five actin genes from the other species have low codon bias values. A Monte Carlo contingency test indicates that for those Drosophila actin genes which exhibit codon bias, the patterns of codon usage are different compared to actin genes from the other species. In addition, the genes exhibiting codon bias also appear to have reduced rates of synonymous substitution. The homogenization phenomenon seen in terms of synonymous substitutions is not observed for nonsynonymous changes. Because of this homogenization phenomenon, ''trees'' constructed based on synonymous substitutions will be affected. These effects can be overt in the case of multigene families, but similar distortions may underlie reconstructions based on single-copy genes which exhibit codon usage bias. }

  Abstract                 = {The epidemiology of acute infections is strongly influenced by the immune status of individuals. In-host models can provide quantitative predictions of immune status and can thus offer valuable insights into the factors that influence transmission between individuals and the effectiveness of vaccination protocols with respect to individual immunity. Here we develop an in-host model of measles infection. The model explicitly considers the effects of immune system memory and C138 T-cells, which are key to measles clearance. The model is used to determine the effects of waning immunity through vaccination and infection, the effects of booster exposures or vaccines on the level of immunity, and the immune system characteristics that result in measles transmission (R-0 > 1) even if an individual has no apparent clinical symptoms. We find that the level of immune system CD8 T-cells at the time of exposure to measles determines whether an individual will experience a measles infection or simply a boost in immunity. We also find that the infected cell dynamics are a good indicator of measles transmission and the degree of symptoms that will be experienced. Our results indicate that the degree of immunity in adults is independent of the source of exposure in early childhood, be it vaccine or natural infection.

  Abstract                 = {For infectious diseases where immunization can offer lifelong protection, a variety of simple models can be used to explain the utility of vaccination as a control method. However, for many diseases, immunity wanes over time and is subsequently enhanced ( boosted) by asymptomatic encounters with the infection. The study of this type of epidemiological process requires a model formulation that can capture both the within-host dynamics of the pathogen and immune system as well as the associated population-level transmission dynamics. Here, we parametrize such a model for measles and show how vaccination can have a range of unexpected consequences as it reduces the natural boosting of immunity as well as reducing the number of naive susceptibles. In particular, we show that moderate waning times (40-80 years) and high levels of vaccination ( greater than 70\%) can induce large-scale oscillations with substantial numbers of symptomatic cases being generated at the peak. In addition, we predict that, after a long disease-free period, the introduction of infection will lead to far larger epidemics than that predicted by standard models. These results have clear implications for the long-term success of any vaccination campaign and highlight the need for a sound understanding of the immunological mechanisms of immunity and vaccination.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental evolution is characterized by exponential or logistic growth and periodic population bottlenecks. The fate of a rare beneficial mutation in these systems is influenced both by the bottleneck effect and by genetic drift. This paper explores the effects of incorporating genetic drift into models of fixation probability in populations with periodic bottlenecks. To model the inherent stochasticity during the growth phase in these populations, we assume a Poisson distribution of offspring. An analytical solution is developed to calculate the fixation probability and a computer simulation is used to verify the results. We find that the fixation rate of a favourable mutant is significantly lower when genetic drift is considered; fixation probability is reduced by over 25\% for realistic experimental protocols. Our method is valid for both weak and strong selection; since very large selection coefficients have been reported in the experimental literature, this is an important improvement over previous results.

Conversely, proteomic analysis is currently much more limited in breadth and depth of coverage owing to variations in protein abundance, hydrophobicity, stability, size and charge. Nevertheless, transcriptomic and proteomic data can be compared and contrasted provided the studies are carefully designed and interpreted. Differential splicing, post-translational modifications and data integration are among some of the future challenges to tackle.}

  Abstract                 = {Optimality models are frequently used to create expectations about phenotypic evolution based on the fittest possible phenotype. However, they often ignore genetic details, which could confound these expectations. We experimentally analyzed the ability of organisms to evolve towards an optimum in an experimentally tractable system, lysis time in bacteriophage T7. T7 lysozyme helps lyse the host cell by degrading its cell wall at the end of infection, allowing viral escape to infect new hosts. Artificial deletion of lysozyme greatly reduced fitness and delayed lysis, but after evolution both phenotypes approached wild-type values. Phage with a lysis-deficient lysozyme evolved similarly. Several mutations were involved in adaptation, but most of the change in lysis timing and fitness increase was mediated by changes in gene 16, an internal virion protein not formerly considered to play a role in lysis. Its muralytic domain, which normally aids genome entry through the cell wall, evolved to cause phage release. Theoretical models suggest there is an optimal lysis time, and lysis more rapid or delayed than this optimum decreases fitness. Artificially constructed lines with very rapid lysis had lower fitness than wild-type T7, in accordance with the model. However, while a slow-lysing line also had lower fitness than wild-type, this low fitness resulted at least partly from genetic details that violated model assumptions.},

The transfer to a suitable expression system is not always achieved easily because of several reasons: genes from different origins might contain codons that are rarely used in the desired host or even bear noncanonical codons, or the genes might hide expression-limiting regulatory elements within their coding sequence. These problems can also be observed when introducing foreign genes into genomes of microalgae as described in a growing number of detailed studies on transgene expression in these organisms. Particularly important for the use of algae as photosynthetic cell factories is a fundamental understanding of the influence of a foreign gene's codon composition on its expression efficiency. Therefore, the effect of codon usage of a chimeric protein on expression. frequency and product accumulation in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was analyzed. This fusion protein combines a constant region encoding the zeocin binding protein Ble with two different gene variants for the green fluorescent protein (GFP). It is shown that codon bias significantly affects the expression, but barely influences the final protein accumulation in this case.},

  Abstract                 = {Protein products of highly expressed genes tend to favor amino acids that have lower average biosynthetic costs (i.e., they exhibit metabolic efficiency). While this trend has been observed in several studies, the specific sites where cost-reducing substitutions accumulate have not been well characterized. Toward that end, weighted costs in conserved and variable positions were evaluated across a total of 9,119 homologous proteins in four mammalian orders (primate, carnivore, rodent, and artiodactyls), which together contain a total of 20,457,072 amino acids. Degree of conservation at homologous positions in these mammalian proteins and average-weighted cost across all positions within a single protein are significantly correlated. Dividing human genes into two classes (those with and those without CpG islands in their promoters) suggests that humans also preferentially utilize less costly amino acids in highly expressed genes. In contrast to the intuitive expectation that the relatively weak selective force associated with metabolic efficiency would be a selection pressure in complex multicellular organisms, the overall level of selective constraint within the variable regions of mammalian proteins allows the metabolic efficiency to derive a reduction of overall biosynthetic cost, particularly in genes with the highest levels of expression.

The major mechanisms involved in the increase of genome sizes are polyploidization and gene duplication. Subsequent gene silencing or mutations, preferentially in regulatory sequences of genes, modify the genome and permit the development of genes with new properties. Mechanisms such as lateral gene transfer, exon shuffling or the creation of new genes by transposition contribute to the evolution of a genome, but remain of relatively restricted relevance. Mechanisms to decrease genome sizes and, in particular, to remove specific DNA sequences, such as blocks of satellite DNAs, appear to involve the action of RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi mechanisms have been proven to be involved in chromatin packaging related with gene inactivation as well as in DNA excision during the macronucleus development in ciliates.}

First, the formulation of E(g) is such that genes with the strongest selected codon usage bias are not likely to have the highest predicted expression levels; indeed the correlation between E(g) and expression level is weak among moderate to highly expressed genes. Second, in some species, highly expressed genes do not have unusual codon usage, and so codon usage cannot be used to predict expression levels. We outline a simple approach, first to check whether a genome shows evidence of selected codon usage bias and then to assess the strength of bias in genes as a guide to their likely expression level; we illustrate this with an analysis of Shewanella oneidensis.},

  Abstract                 = {A population can adapt to a rapid environmental change or habitat expansion in two ways. It may adapt either through new beneficial mutations that subsequently sweep through the population or by using alleles from the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory to calculate the probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then determine the parameter regions where each scenario 'standing variation vs. new mutations 'is more likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation are favored if either the selective advantage is weak or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of 'soft sweeps,” where multiple copies of the selected allele contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps with weaker selective footprints are likely under both scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection coefficient is high. },

  Abstract                 = {In a wide variety of organisms, Synonymous cottons are used with different frequencies, a phenomenon known as colon bias. Population genetic studies have shown that synonymous sites are under weak selection and that codon bias is maintained by a balance between selection, mutation, and genetic drift. It appears that the major Cause for selection oil codon bias is that certain preferred colons are translated more accurately and/or efficiently. However, additional and sometimes may be even contradictory selective forces appear to affect colon usage as well. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the ways ill which natural selection participates lit the creation and maintenance of codon bias. We also raise Several open questions: (i) IS natural selection weak independently of the level of codon bias? It is possible that selection for preferred Colons is weak only when colon bills approaches equilibrium and may be quite strong oil genes with colon bias levels that :ire much lower and/or above equilibrium. (ii) What determines the identity of the major colons? (iii) How do Shifts ill codon bias occur? (iv) What is the exact nature of selection oil colon bias? We discuss these questions in depth and offer some ideas on flow they can be addressed using a combination of computational and experimental analyses. },

  Abstract                 = {We present moments and likelihood methods that estimate a DNA substitution rate from a group of closely related sister species pairs separated at an assumed time. and we test these methods with simulations. The methods also estimate ancestral population size and can test whether there is a significant difference among the ancestral population sizes of the sister species pairs. Estimates presented in the literature often ignore the ancestral coalescent prior to speciation and therefore should be biased upward. The simulations show that both methods yield accurate estimates given sample sizes of five or more species pairs and that better likelihood estimates are obtained if there is no significant difference among ancestral population sizes. The model presented here indicates that the larger than expected variation found in multitaxa datasets can be explained by variation in the ancestral coalescence and the Poisson mutation process. In this context, observed variation can often be accounted for by variation in ancestral population sizes rather than invoking variation in other parameters, such as divergence time or mutation rate. The methods are applied to data from two groups of species pairs (sea urchins and Alpheus snapping shrimp) that are thought to have separated by the rise of Panama three million years ago. }

We argue that {tRNA} gene copy numbers evolve in response to translational selection. In rapidly multiplying organisms, the time spent in translation is a limiting factor in cell division; hence, it pays to duplicate {tRNA} genes, thereby increasing the concentration of {tRNA} molecules in the cell and speeding up translation. In slowly multiplying organisms, translation time is not a limiting factor, so the overall translational cost is minimized by reducing the {tRNA}s to only one copy of each required gene. Translational selection also causes a preference for codons that are most rapidly translated by the current {tRNA}s; hence, codon usage and {tRNA} gene content will coevolve to a state where each is adapted to the other. We show that there is often more than one stable coevolved state. This explains why different combinations of {tRNA}s and codon bias can exist for different amino acids in the same organism. We analyze a set of 80 complete bacterial genomes and show that the theory predicts many of the trends that are seen in these data. },

Here we present approximately 237 million base pairs of sequence for chromosome 2, and 186 million base pairs for chromosome 4, representing more than 99.6\% of their euchromatic sequences. Our initial analyses have identified 1,346 protein-coding genes and 1,239 pseudogenes on chromosome 2, and 796 protein-coding genes and 778 pseudogenes on chromosome 4.

To date, generation of large-scale protein-protein interaction maps has relied on the yeast two-hybrid system, which detects binary interactions through activation of reporter gene expression(2-4). With the advent of ultrasensitive mass spectrometric protein identification methods, it is feasible to identify directly protein complexes on a proteome-wide scale(5,6). Here we report, using the budding yeast \emph{{S}accharomyces cerevisiae} as a test case, an example of this approach, which we term high-throughput mass spectrometric protein complex identification (HMS-PCI). Beginning with 10PERCENT of predicted yeast proteins as baits, we detected 3,617 associated proteins covering 25PERCENT of the yeast proteome. Numerous protein complexes were identified, including many new interactions in various signalling pathways and in the {DNA} damage response. Comparison of the HMS-PCI data set with interactions reported in the literature revealed an average threefold higher success rate in detection of known complexes compared with large-scale two-hybrid studies(3,4). Given the high degree of connectivity observed in this study, even partial HMS-PCI coverage of complex proteomes, including that of humans, should allow comprehensive identification of cellular networks.},

Yet the amount of viral RNA contained within an HIV-expressing cell and the relationship between the number of virus-producing cells and plasma virus load has not been established or reflected in models of viral dynamics. We report here a novel strategy for the coordinated analysis of virus expression in lymph node specimens. The results obtained for patients with a broad range of plasma viral loads before and after antiretroviral therapy reveal a constant mean viral (v)RNA copy number (3.6 log(10) copies) per infected cell, regardless of plasma virus load or treatment status. In addition, there was a significant but nonlinear direct correlation between the frequency of vRNA(+) lymph node cells and plasma vRNA. As predicted From this relationship, residual cells expressing this same mean copy number are detectable (frequency <2/10(6) cells) in tissues of treated patients who have plasma vRNA levels below the current detectable threshold (<50 copies/ml). These data suggest that fully replication-active cells are responsible for sustaining viremia after initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy and that plasma virus titers con-elate, albeit in a nonlinear fashion, with the number of virus-expressing cells in lymphoid tissue.},

Using complete genome sequences of \emph{Escherichia coli}, we show that local intra-strand secondary structures can, as a consequence, be used to define an index of transcription-driven mutability. At gene level, we show that natural selection has favoured a reduced transcription-driven mutagenesis via the higher than expected frequency of occurrence of intra-strand secondary structures. Such selection is stronger in highly expressed genes and suggests a sequence-dependent way to control mutation rates and a novel form of selection affecting the evolution of synonymous mutations. },

  Abstract                 = {The related bacteriopliages phiX174 and G4 were adapted to the inhibitory temperature of 44degrees and monitored for nucleotide changes throughout the genome. Phage were evolved by serial transfer at low multiplicity of infection on rapidly dividing bacteria to Select genotypes with the fastest rates of reproduction. Both phage showed overall greater fitness effects per substitution during tire early stages of adaptation. The fitness of phiX174 improved from -0.7 to 5.6 doublings of phage concentration per generation. Five missense mutations were observed. The earliest two mutations accounted for 85\% of the ultimate fitness gain. In contrast, G4 required adaptation to the intermediate temperature of 41.5degrees before it could be maintained at 44degrees. Its fitness at 44degrees increased from -2.7 to 3.2, nearly the same net gain as in phiX174, but With three times the opportunity for adaptation. Seventeen mutations were observed in G4: 14 missense, 2 silent, and 1 intergenic. The first 3 missense substitutions accounted for over half the ultimate fitness increase. Although the expected pattern of periodic selective sweeps was the most common one for both phage, some mutations were lost after becoming frequent, and long-term polymorphism was observed. This study provides the greatest detail yet in combining fitness profiles with the underlying pattern of genetic changes, and the results support recent theories on the range of fitness effects of substitutions fixed during adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {When multiple victim species (e.g. prey, host) are attacked by one or more shared enemy species (e.g. predator, pathogen), the potential exists for apparent competition between victim populations. We review ideas on apparent competition (also called ''competition for enemy-free space'') and sketch illustrative examples. One puzzling aspect of this indirect interaction is the repeated rediscovery of the essential ideas. Apparent competition arises between focal and alternative prey populations because, in the long term, enemy abundance depends on total prey availability; by increasing enemy numbers, alternative prey intensify predation on focal prey. A frequent empirical finding, consistent with theory, is exclusion of victim species from local communities by resident enemies. Theory suggests victim-species coexistence depends on particular conditions. To understand fully the consequences of shared enemies requires a body of contingent theory, specifying the time-scale of the interactions (short-and long-term consequences of sharing enemies generally differ), the structure of the food-web encompassing the interactions, its spatial context, etc. The ''core criterion'' for a focal victim species to invade a community supporting a resident, polyphagous enemy is r > aP (the invader's intrinsic rate of increase should exceed attack rate times average enemy abundance). A growing body of data and observations test, and support, this prediction.},

To distinguish mutational and selectional effects, the genes were subdivided into three groups with different codon usage bias and the gradients of nucleotide usage were studied in each group. Some combinations that can be associated with a propensity for processivity errors show strong negative gradients that become weaker in genes with tow codon bias, consistent with a selection on translational efficiency. One of the strongest gradients is for third position G, which shows a pervasive positive gradient in usage in most contexts of surrounding bases. },

Such context biases are different in different organisms and can be used as genomic signatures. In this paper, we will focus specifically on the dinucleotide composed of a third codon position nucleotide and its succeeding first position nucleotide. Using the 16 possible dinucleotide combinations, we calculate how well individual genes conform to the observed mean dinucleotide frequencies of an entire genome, forming a distance measure for each gene. It is found that genes from different genomes can be separated with a high degree of accuracy, according to these distance values. in particular, we address the problem of recent horizontal gene transfer, and how imported genes may be evaluated by their poor assimilation to the host's context biases. By concentrating on the thirdand succeeding first position nucleotides, we eliminate most spurious contributions from codon usage and amino-acid requirements, focusing mainly on mutational effects. Since imported genes are expected to converge only gradually to genomic signatures, it is possible to question whether a gene present in only one of two closely related organisms has been imported into one organism or deleted in the other. Striking correlations between the proposed distance measure and poor homology are observed when \emph{Escherichia coli} genes are compared to Salmonella typhi, indicating that sets of outlier genes in E. coli may contain a high number of genes that have been imported into E. coli, and not deleted in S. typhi. }

  Abstract                 = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are essential for protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, tRNA biosynthesis employs a specialized RNA polymerase that generates initial transcripts that must be subsequently altered via a multitude of post-transcriptional steps before the tRNAs beome mature molecules that function in protein synthesis. Genetic, genomic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches possible in the powerful Saccharomyces cerevisiae system have led to exciting advances in our understandings of tRNA post-transcriptional processing as well as to novel insights into tRNA turnover and tRNA subcellular dynamics. tRNA processing steps include removal of transcribed leader and trailer sequences, addition of CCA to the 3' mature sequence and, for tRNA(His), addition of a 5' G. About 20\% of yeast tRNAs are encoded by intron-containing genes. The three-step splicing process to remove the introns surprisingly occurs in the cytoplasm in yeast and each of the splicing enzymes appears to moonlight in functions in addition to tRNA splicing. There are 25 different nucleoside modifications that are added post-transcriptionally, creating tRNAs in which similar to 15\% of the residues are nucleosides other than A, G, U, or C. These modified nucleosides serve numerous important functions including tRNA discrimination, translation fidelity, and tRNA quality control. Mature tRNAs are very stable, but nevertheless yeast cells possess multiple pathways to degrade inappropriately processed or folded tRNAs. Mature tRNAs are also dynamic in cells, moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and back again to the cytoplasm; the mechanism and function of this retrograde process is poorly understood. Here, the state of knowledge for tRNA post-transcriptional processing, turnover, and subcellular dynamics is addressed, highlighting the questions that remain.},

Discussed here are some of the recently identified visual and chemosensory genes that are involved in mate choice and mating behavior. These genes' products are involved in the production, transmission, and receipt of crucial sensory mate-choice cues that affect fitness. This review exposes newfound evidence that alternative splicnig, gene-expression pattern changes, and molecular genetic variation in sensory genes are crucial for both intraand interspecific mate choice and mating success. Many sensory genes have arisen through gene duplications, and data amassed from studies conducted at scales ranging from individual genes to genomic comparisons show that strong, positive Darwinian selection acts on several mating-related genes and that these genes evolve rapidly.

Students become fluent in the universal language of data analysis as they decipher the figures, interpret the findings, and propose and defend further experiments to test their own hypotheses about the system under study. At the end of the course students gain insight into the individual experiences of article authors by reading authors' responses to an e-mail questionnaire generated by CREATE students. Assessment data indicate that CREATE students gain in ability to read and critically analyze scientific data, as well as in their understanding of, and interest in, research and researchers. The CREATE approach demystifies the process of reading a scientific article and at the same time humanizes scientists. The positive response of students to this method suggests that it could make a significant contribution to retaining undergraduates as science majors. },

  Abstract                 = {Haploinsufficiency, wherein a single functional copy of a gene is insufficient to maintain normal function, is a major cause of dominant disease. Human disease studies have identified several hundred haploinsufficient (HI) genes. We have compiled a map of 1,079 haplosufficient (HS) genes by systematic identification of genes unambiguously and repeatedly compromised by copy number variation among 8,458 apparently healthy individuals and contrasted the genomic, evolutionary, functional, and network properties between these HS genes and known HI genes. We found that HI genes are typically longer and have more conserved coding sequences and promoters than HS genes. HI genes exhibit higher levels of expression during early development and greater tissue specificity. Moreover, within a probabilistic human functional interaction network HI genes have more interaction partners and greater network proximity to other known HI genes. We built a predictive model on the basis of these differences and annotated 12,443 genes with their predicted probability of being haploinsufficient. We validated these predictions of haploinsufficiency by demonstrating that genes with a high predicted probability of exhibiting haploinsufficiency are enriched among genes implicated in human dominant diseases and among genes causing abnormal phenotypes in heterozygous knockout mice. We have transformed these gene-based haploinsufficiency predictions into haploinsufficiency scores for genic deletions, which we demonstrate to better discriminate between pathogenic and benign deletions than consideration of the deletion size or numbers of genes deleted. These robust predictions of haploinsufficiency support clinical interpretation of novel loss-of-function variants and prioritization of variants and genes for follow-up studies.},

  Abstract                 = {In a wide range of genomes, it was observed that the usage of synonymous codons is biased toward specific codons and codon patterns. Factors that are implicated in the selection for codon usage include facilitation of fast and accurate translation. There are two types of translational errors: missense errors and processivity errors. There is considerable evidence in support of the hypothesis that codon usage is optimized to minimize missense errors. In contrast, little is known about the relationship between codon usage and frameshifting errors, an important form of processivity errors, which appear to occur at frequencies comparable to the frequencies of missense errors. Based on the recently proposed pause-and-slip model of frameshifting, we developed Frameshifting Robustness Score (FRS). We used this measure to test if the pattern of codon usage indicates optimization against frameshifting errors. We found that the FRS values of protein-coding sequences from four analyzed genomes (the bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyce pombe) were typically higher than expected by chance. Other properties of FRS patterns observed in B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, such as the tendency of FRS to increase from the 5'- to 3'-end of protein-coding sequences, were also consistent with the hypothesis of optimization against frameshifting errors in translation. For E. coli, the results of different tests were less consistent, suggestive of a much weaker optimization, if any. Collectively, the results fit the concept of selection against mistranslation-induced protein misfolding being one of the factors shaping the evolution of both coding and non-coding sequences.},

Notable findings have included the identification of the transferrin receptor TfR as the cell surface receptor for canine parvovirus and feline panleukopenia virus, and also the finding that specific binding to the canine TfR led to the emergence of canine parvovirus as a new pathogen in dogs. The structures of the adeno-associated virus-2 and porcine parvovirus capsids, along with those of the minute virus of mice, have also advanced our understanding of parvovirus biology. Structure-function studies have shown that in several different parvoviruses the threefold spikes or peaks of the capsid control several aspects of cell tropism and host range, and that those are subject to selective pressures leading to viral evolution. The cell and tissue tropisms of different adeno-associated virus serotypes were demonstrated to be due, in part, to specific receptor binding.},

  Abstract                 = {Most methods for detecting Darwinian natural selection at the molecular level rely on estimating the rates or numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous changes in an alignment of protein-coding DNA sequences. In some of these methods, the nonsynonymous rate of substitution is allowed to vary across the sequence, permitting the identification of single amino acid positions that are under positive natural selection. However, it is unclear which probability distribution should be used to describe how the nonsynonymous rate of substitution varies across the sequence. One widely used solution is to model variation in the nonsynonymous rate across the sequence as a mixture of several discrete or continuous probability distributions. Unfortunately, there is little population genetics theory to inform us of the appropriate probability distribution for among-site variation in the nonsynonymous rate of substitution. Here, we describe an approach to modeling variation in the nonsynonymous rate of substitution by using a Dirichlet process mixture model. The Dirichlet process allows there to be a countably infinite number of nonsynonymous rate classes and is very flexible in accommodating different potential distributions for the nonsynonymous rate of substitution. We implemented the model in a fully Bayesian approach, with all parameters of the model considered as random variables.},

However, the extent of the differences between the dynamics of the contacts, and the contribution of contact duration and frequency to the functional T cell outcome, remain a matter of debate. Recently, experimental models have been developed to address the role of contact stability in T cell function \emph{in vivo}, which use real-time imaging of DC-T cell interactions. }

Results: We developed a 'Virtual Northern' method, using DNA microarrays for genome-wide systematic analysis of {mRNA} lengths. We used this method to measure {mRNA}s corresponding to 84\% of the annotated open reading frames (ORFs) in the S. cerevisiae genome, with high precision and accuracy ( measurement errors +/- 67\%). We found a close linear relationship between {mRNA} lengths and the lengths of known or predicted translated sequences; {mRNA}s were typically around 300 nucleotides longer than the translated sequences. Analysis of genes deviating from that relationship identified ORFs with annotation errors, ORFs that appear not to be bona fide genes, and potentially novel genes. Interestingly, we found that systematic differences in the total length of the untranslated sequences in {mRNA}s were related to the functions of the encoded proteins. Conclusions: The Virtual Northern method provides a practical and efficient method for genome-scale analysis of transcript lengths. Approximately 12-15\% of the yeast genome is represented in untranslated sequences of {mRNA}s. A systematic relationship between the lengths of the untranslated regions in yeast {mRNA}s and the functions of the proteins they encode may point to an important regulatory role for these sequences. }

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Much of a cell's regulatory response to changing environments occurs at the transcriptional level. Particularly in higher organisms, transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs and epigenetic modifications can combine to form a complex regulatory network. Part of this system can be modeled as a collection of regulatory modules: co-regulated genes, the conditions under which they are co-regulated and sequence-level regulatory motifs. RESULTS: We present the Combinatorial Algorithm for Expression and Sequence-based Cluster Extraction (COALESCE) system for regulatory module prediction. The algorithm is efficient enough to discover expression biclusters and putative regulatory motifs in metazoan genomes (>20,000 genes) and very large microarray compendia (>10,000 conditions). Using Bayesian data integration, it can also include diverse supporting data types such as evolutionary conservation or nucleosome placement. We validate its performance using a functional evaluation of co-clustered genes, known yeast and Escherichea coli TF targets, synthetic data and various metazoan data compendia. In all cases, COALESCE performs as well or better than current biclustering and motif prediction tools, with high accuracy in functional and TF/target assignments and zero false positives on synthetic data. COALESCE provides an efficient and flexible platform within which large, diverse data collections can be integrated to predict metazoan regulatory networks.

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are charged with an amino acid and brought to the ribosome, where they are paired with the corresponding trinucleotide codon in {mRNA}. The amino acid is attached to the nascent polypeptide and the ribosome moves on to the next codon. The cycle is then repeated to produce a full-length protein. Proofreading and editing processes are used throughout protein synthesis to ensure the faithful translation of genetic information. The maturation of tRNAs and mRNAs is monitored, as is the identity of amino acids attached to tRNAs. Accuracy is further enhanced during the selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs on the ribosome and their base pairing with {mRNA}. Recent studies have begun to reveal the molecular mechanisms underpinning quality control and go some way to explaining the phenomenal accuracy of translation first observed over three decades ago.},

  Abstract                 = {Translation uses the genetic information in messenger RNA (mRNA) to synthesize proteins. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are charged with an amino acid and brought to the ribosome, where they are paired with the corresponding trinucleotide codon in mRNA. The amino acid is attached to the nascent polypeptide and the ribosome moves on to the next codon. The cycle is then repeated to produce a full-length protein. Proofreading and editing processes are used throughout protein synthesis to ensure the faithful translation of genetic information. The maturation of tRNAs and mRNAs is monitored, as is the identity of amino acids attached to tRNAs. Accuracy is further enhanced during the selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs on the ribosome and their base pairing with mRNA. Recent studies have begun to reveal the molecular mechanisms underpinning quality control and go some way to explaining the phenomenal accuracy of translation first observed over three decades ago. },

Codon use correlates with tRNA gene copy number in noncomplex organisms including yeasts. Synonymous codons impact translation with various outcomes, dependent on relative tRNA abundances. Availability of whole-genome sequences allowed us to examine tRNA gene copy number variation (tgCNV) and codon use in four Schizosaccharomyces species and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. tRNA gene numbers vary from 171 to 322 in the four Schizosaccharomyces despite very high similarity in other features of their genomes. In addition, we performed whole-genome sequencing of several related laboratory strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and found tgCNV at a cluster of tRNA genes. We examined for the first time effects of wobble rules on correlation of tRNA gene number and codon use and showed improvement for S. cerevisiae and three of the Schizosaccharomyces species. In contrast, correlation in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus is poor due to markedly divergent tRNA gene content, and much worsened by the wobble rules. In japonicus, some tRNA iso-acceptor genes are absent and others are greatly reduced relative to the other yeasts, while genes for synonymous wobble iso-acceptors are amplified, indicating wobble use not apparent in any other eukaryote. We identified a subset of japonicus-specific wobbles that improves correlation of codon use and tRNA gene content in japonicus. We conclude that tgCNV is high among Schizo species and occurs in related laboratory strains of S. pombe (and expectedly other species), and tRNAome-codon analyses can provide insight into species-specific wobble decoding.},

  Abstract                 = {Natural selection appears to discriminate among synonymous codons to enhance translational efficiency in a wide range of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Codon bias is strongly related to gene expression levels in these species. In addition, between-gene variation in silent DNA divergence is inversely correlated with codon bias. However, in mammals, between-gene comparisons are complicated by distinctive nucleotide-content bias (isochores) throughout the genome. In this study, we attempted to identify translational selection by analyzing the DNA sequences of alternatively spliced genes in humans and in Drosophila melanogaster. Among codons in an alternatively spliced gene, those in constitutively expressed exons are translated more often than those in alternatively spliced exons. Thus, translational selection should act more strongly to bias codon usage and reduce silent divergence in constitutive than in alternative exons. By controlling for regional forces affecting base-composition evolution, this within-gene comparison makes it possible to detect codon selection at synonymous sites in mammals. We found that GC-ending codons are more abundant in constitutive than alternatively spliced exons in both Drosophila and humans. Contrary to our expectation, however, silent DNA divergence between mammalian species is higher in constitutive than in alternative exons. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

To see explicitly the effects of fluctuation of population size on the effective size, we investigate a special case where population size fluctuates between two distinct states. In some cases, the effective size is very different front the harmonic mean. For this concrete model, we also obtain the stationary distribution of the average heterozygosity.

  Abstract                 = {Populations of Plasmodium falciparum show striking differences in linkage disequilibrium, population differentiation and diversity, but only fragmentary data exists on the genetic structure of Plasmodium vivax. We genotyped nine tandem repeat loci bearing 2-8 bp motifs from 345 P. vivax infections collected from three Asian countries and from five locations in Colombia. We observed 9-37 alleles per locus and high diversity (H-e = 0.72-0.79, mean = 0.75) in all countries. Numbers of multiple clone infections varied considerably: these were rare in Colombia and India, but >60\% of isolates carried multiple alleles in at least one locus in Thailand and Laos. However, only one or two of the nine loci show >1 allele in many samples, suggesting that mutation within infections may result in overestimation of true multiple carriage rates. Identical nine-locus genotypes were frequently found in Colombian populations, contributing to strong linkage disequilibrium. These identical genotypes were strongly clustered in time, consistent with epidemic transmission of clones and subsequent breakdown of allelic associations, suggesting high rates of inbreeding and low effective recombination rates in this country. In contrast, identical genotypes were rare and loci were randomly associated in all three Asian populations, consistent with higher rates of outcrossing and recombination. We observed low but significant differentiation between different Asian countries (standardized, F-ST =0.13-0.45). In comparison, we see greater differentiation between collection locations within Colombia (standardized F-ST = 0.4-0.7), and strong differentiation between continents (standardized F-ST = 0.48-0.79). The observed heterogeneity in multiple clone carriage rates, linkage disequilibrium and population differentiation are similar in some, but not all, respects to those observed in P. falciparum, and have important implications for the design of association mapping studies, and interpretation of P. vivax epidemiology.

Here we report our analysis of translation and decay of nonstop {mRNA}s in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the reduction of nonstop {mRNA}s was only 4.5-fold, a level that is sufficient for residual protein synthesis, translation products of nonstop {mRNA}s were hardly detectable. We show that nonstop {mRNA}s were associated with polysomes, but not with Pab1p. We also show that ribosomes translating nonstop {mRNA} formed stable and heavy polysome complexes with {mRNA}. These data suggest that ribosome stalling at the 3' end of nonstop {mRNA} may block further rounds of translation, hence repressing protein synthesis. Furthermore, it was found that the 5'\&RARR; 3' decay pathway was accelerated for nonstop {mRNA} decay in the absence of Ski7p. We also found that translation of aberrant {mRNA}s with a shortened 3'-UTR was repressed, suggesting that an improper spatial distance between the termination codon and the 3' end of {mRNA} results in translation repression. },

However, natural selection on codon usage is considered to be a weak evolutionary force and selection on codon usage is expected to be strongest in species with large effective population sizes. In this paper, I study associations between codon usage, gene expression, and molecular evolution at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in the long-lived, woody perennial plant Populus tremula (Salicaceae). Using expression data for 558 genes derived from expressed sequence tags (EST) libraries from 19 different tissues and developmental stages, I study how gene expression levels within single tissues as well as across tissues affect codon usage and rates sequence evolution at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. I show that gene expression have direct effects on both codon usage and the level of selective constraint of proteins in P. tremula, although in different ways. Codon usage genes is primarily determined by how highly expressed a genes is, whereas rates of sequence evolution are primarily determined by how widely expressed genes are. In addition to the effects of gene expression, protein length appear to be an important factor influencing virtually all aspects of molecular evolution in P. tremula.},

  Abstract                 = {One important goal of population genetics is to understand the relative importance of different evolutionary processes for shaping variation in natural populations. Here, I use multilocus data to show that natural selection on both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations plays an important role in shaping levels of synonymous polymorphism in European aspen (Populus tremula). Previous studies have documented a preferential fixation of synonymous mutations encoding preferred codons in P. tremula. The results presented here show that this has resulted in an increase in codon bias in P. tremula, consistent with stronger selection acting on synonymous codon usage. In addition, positive selection on nonsynonymous mutations appears to be common in P. tremula, with approximately 30\% of all mutations having been fixed by positive selection. In addition, the recurrent fixation of beneficial mutations also reduces standing levels of polymorphism as evidenced by a significantly negative relationship between the rate of protein evolution synonymous site diversity and silent site diversity. Finally, I use approximate Bayesian methods to estimate the strength of selection acting on beneficial substitutions. These calculations show that recurrent hitchhiking reduces polymorphism by, on average, 30\%. The product of strength of selection acting on beneficial mutations and the rate by which these occur across the genome (2N(e)lambda s) equals 1.54x10 (- 7), which is in line with estimates from Drosophila where recurrent hitchhiking has also been shown to have significant effects on standing levels of polymorphism. },

These results are consistent with the findings that translational step times are influenced by codon context and that these context effects are related to the compatabilities of adjacent {tRNA} isoacceptor molecules on the surface of a translating ribosome. These results also support our previous suggestion that the frequency of one codon next to another has co-evolved with the structure and abundance of {tRNA} isoacceptors in order to control the rates of translational step times without imposing additional constraints on amino acid sequences or protein structures.}

  Abstract                 = {Background: Knowledge about the abundance of molecular components is an important prerequisite for building quantitative predictive models of cellular behavior. Proteins are central components of these models, since they carry out most of the fundamental processes in the cell. Thus far, protein concentrations have been difficult to measure on a large scale, but proteomic technologies have now advanced to a stage where this information becomes readily accessible. Results: Here, we describe an experimental scheme to maximize the coverage of proteins identified by mass spectrometry of a complex biological sample. Using a combination of LC-MS/MS approaches with protein and peptide fractionation steps we identified 1103 proteins from the cytosolic fraction of the \emph{Escherichia coli} strain MC4100. A measure of abundance is presented for each of the identified proteins, based on the recently developed emPAI approach which takes into account the number of sequenced peptides per protein. The values of abundance are within a broad range and accurately reflect independently measured copy numbers per cell. As expected, the most abundant proteins were those involved in protein synthesis, most notably ribosomal proteins. Proteins involved in energy metabolism as well as those with binding function were also found in high copy number while proteins annotated with the terms metabolism, transcription, transport, and cellular organization were rare. The barrel-sandwich fold was found to be the structural fold with the highest abundance. Highly abundant proteins are predicted to be less prone to aggregation based on their length, pI values, and occurrence patterns of hydrophobic stretches. We also find that abundant proteins tend to be predominantly essential. Additionally we observe a significant correlation between protein and {mRNA} abundance in E. coli cells. Conclusion: Abundance measurements for more than 1000 E. coli proteins presented in this work represent the most complete study of protein abundance in a bacterial cell so far. We show significant associations between the abundance of a protein and its properties and functions in the cell. In this way, we provide both data and novel insights into the role of protein concentration in this model organism.},

  Abstract                 = {\emph{Escherichia coli} is one of the best elucidated organisms. However, about 40\% of E coli genes have not been assigned to their function yet. We analyzed 1440 single gene knock-out mutants using the GN2-MicroPlate, which permits assay of 95 carbon-source utilizations simultaneously. In the knock-out library there are 1044 of so called y-genes with no apparent function. The raw dataset was analyzed and genes were interrelated by the clustering method of the GeneSpring (TM) software. In the resulted dendrogram of genes, a group of genes with known and related function tended to be assembled into a cluster. Our clustering method would be useful for functional assignment of so called y-genes with no apparent function, since the resulted dendrogram could connect y-genes to phenotype and function of well-studied genes.

  Abstract                 = {Protein-protein interactions play crucial roles in the execution of various biological functions. Accordingly, their comprehensive description would contribute considerably to the functional interpretation of fully sequenced genomes, which are flooded with novel genes of unpredictable functions. We previously developed a system to examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible combinations between the approximate to6,000 proteins of the budding yeast \emph{{S}accharomyces cerevisiae}. Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278 proteins. Unexpectedly, these data do not largely overlap with those obtained by the other project [Uetz, P,, et al. (2000) Nature (London) 403, 623-627] and hence have substantially expanded our knowledge on the protein interaction space or interactome of the yeast. Cumulative connection of these binary interactions generates a single huge network linking the vast majority of the proteins. Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically relevant interactions highlights various intriguing subnetworks. They include, for instance, the one that had successfully foreseen the involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body function as well as the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified multiprotein complex potentially participating in the process of vesicular transport. Our data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually leads to thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system.},

These "parallel codes" include binding sequences for regulatory and structural proteins, signals for splicing, and {RNA} secondary structure. Here, we show that the universal genetic code can efficiently carry arbitrary parallel codes much better than the vast majority of other possible genetic codes. This property is related to the identity of the stop codons. We find that the ability to support parallel codes is strongly tied to another useful property of the genetic code--minimization of the effects of frame-shift translation errors. Whereas many of the known regulatory codes reside in nontranslated regions of the genome, the present findings suggest that protein-coding regions can readily carry abundant additional information.},

  Abstract                 = {The growth and reproductive schedule of terrestrial plants can be usefully studied as the dynamic optimal allocation of material between different organs. This idea, pioneered by Dan Cohen, has been formalized as an optimal control problem and analysed using Pontryagin's maximum principle or dynamic programming. Here, I review several examples of dynamic resource allocation models. First, the seasonal timing of reproduction of annuals is discussed. This can be extended to plants with multiple vegetative organs and the optimal shoot-root balance is assessed. Secondly, the growth schedule over multiple seasons is examined, and the reproductive effort, the leaf phenology of deciduous perennials, and the conditions under which perenniality is more advantageous than annuality are considered. With some modifications, the same model can handle intermittent reproduction and monocarpic perennials (one large reproduction after many years). Thirdly, growth in an unpredictably fluctuating environment is analysed for the case in which a sudden disturbance (herbivory or fire) removes the photosynthetic system altogether, followed by recovery using stored material, and for the case in which environmental productivity fluctuates in a Markovian process. Finally, the optimal level of chemical defence against herbivory is formalized and used to explain the intensity of alkaloid defence decreasing with leaf age. These examples illustrate the usefulness of dynamic resource allocation models in understanding plant life-history adaptation.},

By comparing the his3 hybridization signal from a known amount of yeast cells to the signal generated by a known amount of his3 RNA synthesized in vitro, we determine that yeast strain KY114 growing in yeast extract/peptone/glucose medium at 30 degrees C contains seven molecules of his3 mRNA per cell. Using a galactose shut-off procedure, we determined that the half-life of his3 mRNA is approximately 11 min under these conditions. From these observations, we calculate that one his3 mRNA molecule is synthesized every 140 s. Analysis of other his3 promoter derivatives suggests that the maximal transcriptional initiation rate in yeast cells is one mRNA molecule every 6-8 s. Using his3 as an internal standard, the number of mRNA molecules per cell have been determined for ded1, trp3, rps4, and gall under a variety of growth conditions. From these results, the absolute mRNA level of any yeast gene can be determined in a single hybridization experiment. Moreover, the rate of transcriptional initiation can be determined for mRNAs whose decay rates are known.},

  Abstract                 = {The control of RNA synthesis from protein-coding genes is fundamental in determining the various cell types of higher eukaryotes. The activation of these genes is driven by promoter complexes, and RNA synthesis is performed by an enzyme mega-complex--the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. These two complexes are the fundamental components required to initiate gene expression and generate the primary transcripts that, after processing, yield mRNAs that pass to the cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs. But although this gene expression pathway has been studied intensively, aspects of RNA metabolism remain difficult to comprehend. In particular, it is unclear why >95\% of RNA polymerized by polymerase II remains in the nucleus, where it is recycled. To explain this apparent paradox, this review presents a detailed description of nuclear RNA (nRNA) metabolism in mammalian cells. We evaluate the number of active transcription units, discuss the distribution of polymerases on active genes, and assess the efficiency with which the products mature and pass to the cytoplasm. Differences between the behavior of mRNAs on this productive pathway and primary transcripts that never leave the nucleus lead us to propose that these represent distinct populations. We discuss possible roles for nonproductive RNAs and present a model to describe the metabolism of these RNAs in the nuclei of mammalian cells. },

Centromeres consist of repeated sequences, which have hindered the study of centromere mitotic recombination and its consequences for centromeric function. We use a chromosome orientation fluorescence in situ hybridization technique to visualize and quantify recombination events at mouse centromeres. We show that centromere mitotic recombination occurs in normal cells to a higher frequency than telomere recombination and to a much higher frequency than chromosome-arm recombination. Furthermore, we show that centromere mitotic recombination is increased in cells lacking the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b DNA methyltransferases, suggesting that the epigenetic state of centromeric heterochromatin controls recombination events at these regions. Increased centromere recombination in Dnmt3a, 3b-deficient cells is accompanied by changes in the length of centromere repeats, suggesting that prevention of illicit centromere recombination is important to maintain centromere integrity in the mouse.},

The pattern of high contagiousness during the primary infection followed by a large drop in infectiousness may explain the pattern of epidemic spread seen in male homosexual cohorts in the early years of the epidemic. Simulations of cohorts of homosexual males, using that range of parameter values, indicate the following: (a) the initial fast rise and then more or less rapid flattening of the incidence curve of seropositives is primarily due to rapid initial spread, yielding a group of infecteds all of whom pass into the low infectivity asymptomatic period at close to the same time. All this occurs only if the basic reproduction number for the primary infection is >1. (b) the behavioral changes that have been reported all started after the incidence of new infections began to fall, too late to have a major effect on the initial rise. The behavioral changes had a major effect in slowing down the subsequent rise in the number of seropositives. (c) High activity groups play an important role in the early rapid rise of the epidemic. However, it is not likely that the rapid decrease in rate of growth of seropositives is solely due to saturation of these very high activity groups. Although the evidence for this interpretation of the role of the primary infection is not conclusive, its implications for prevention and for vaccine trials are so markedly different from those of other interpretations that we consider it to be an important hypothesis for further testing.}

Prosocial acts can be (i) reactive, i.e. in response to specific stimuli, or (ii) proactive, i.e. occur in the absence of such stimuli. We propose that reactive prosocial acts reflect sensitivity to (i) signals or signs of need and (ii) the presence and size of an audience, as modified by (iii) social distance to the partner or partners. We examine the evidence for these elements in humans and other animals, especially non-human primates, based on the natural history of cooperation, quantified in the context of food sharing, and various experimental paradigms. The comparison suggests that humans share with their closest living relatives reactive responses to signals of need, but differ in sensitivity to signs of need and cues of being watched, as well as in the presence of proactive prosociality. We discuss ultimate explanations for these derived features, in particular the adoption of cooperative breeding as well as concern for reputation and costly signalling during human evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Most eukaryotic genes are interrupted by noncoding introns that must be accurately removed from pre- messenger RNAs to produce translatable {mRNA}s(1). Splicing is guided locally by short conserved sequences, but genes typically contain many potential splice sites, and the mechanisms specifying the correct sites remain poorly understood. In most organisms, short introns recognized by the intron definition mechanism(2) cannot be efficiently predicted solely on the basis of sequence motifs(3). In multicellular eukaryotes, long introns are recognized through exon definition(2) and most genes produce multiple {mRNA} variants through alternative splicing(4). The nonsense- mediated {mRNA} decay(5,6) ( NMD) pathway may further shape the observed sets of variants by selectively degrading those containing premature termination codons, which are frequently produced in mammals(7,8). Here we show that the tiny introns of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia are under strong selective pressure to cause premature termination of {mRNA} translation in the event of intron retention, and that the same bias is observed among the short introns of plants, fungi and animals. By knocking down the two P. tetraurelia genes encoding UPF1, a protein that is crucial in NMD, we show that the intrinsic efficiency of splicing varies widely among introns and that NMD activity can significantly reduce the fraction of unspliced {mRNA}s. The results suggest that, independently of alternative splicing, species with large intron numbers universally rely on NMD to compensate for suboptimal splicing efficiency and accuracy. },

A simple stochastic model based on multiplicative processes has been proposed to explain the sequence length distribution. The stochastic model supports the random-origin hypothesis of protein sequences in genomes. Distributions of large proteins deviate from the overall lognormal behavior. Their cumulative distribution follows a power-law analogous to Pareto's law used to describe the income distribution of the wealthy.

However, measuring the rate of protein synthesis is the only way to determine the translational rate of gene transcripts. Here, we report a technique to measure the rate of incorporation of amino acids from ingested protein labeled with stable isotope into individual plasma proteins. This approach involves three steps: 1) production of stable isotope-labeled milk whey protein, oral administration of this intrinsically labeled protein, and subsequent collection of blood samples; 2) fractionation of the plasma and separation of the individual plasma proteins by a combination of anion exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis; and 3) identification of individual plasma proteins by tandem mass spectrometry and measurement of stable isotopic enrichment of these proteins by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This method allowed the measurement of the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of 29 different plasma proteins by using the same precursor pool. We noted a 30-fold difference in FSR of different plasma proteins with a wide range of physiological functions. This approach offers a tremendous opportunity to study the regulation of plasma proteins in humans in many physiological and pathological states. }

  Abstract                 = {Highly expressed genes in many bacteria and small eukaryotes often have a strong compositional bias, in terms of codon usage. Two widely used numerical indices, the codon adaptation index (CAI) and the codon usage, use this bias to predict the expression level of genes. When these indices were first introduced, they were based on fairly simple assumptions about which genes are most highly expressed: the CAI was originally based on the codon composition of a set of only 24 highly expressed genes, and the codon usage on assumptions about which functional classes of genes are highly expressed in fast-growing bacteria. Given the recent advent of genome-wide expression data, we should be able to improve on these assumptions. Here, we measure, in yeast, the degree to which consideration of the current genome-wide expression data sets improves the performance of both numerical indices. Indeed, we find that by changing the parameterization of each model its correlation with actual expression levels can be somewhat improved, although both indices are fairly insensitive to the exact way they are parameterized. This insensitivity indicates a consistent codon bias amongst highly expressed genes. We also attempt direct linear regression of codon composition against genome-wide expression levels (and protein abundance data). This has some similarity with the CAI formalism and yields an alternative model for the prediction of expression levels based on the coding sequences of genes.

  Abstract                 = {We analyzed 10 genome expression data sets by large-scale cross-referencing against broad structural and functional categories. The data sets, generated by different techniques (e.g. SAGE and gene chips), provide various representations of the yeast transcriptome (the set of all yeast genes, weighted by transcript abundance). Our analysis enabled us to determine features more prevalent in the transcriptome than the genome: i.e. those that are common to highly expressed proteins. Starting with simplest categories, we find that, relative to the genome, the transcriptome is enriched in Ala and Gly and depleted in Asn and very long proteins. We find, furthermore, that protein length and maximum expression level have a roughly inverse relationship. To relate expression level and protein structure, we assigned transmembrane helices and known folds (using PSI-blast) to each protein in the genome; this allowed us to determine that the transcriptome is enriched in mixed alpha-beta structures and depleted in membrane proteins relative to the genome. In particular, some enzymatic folds, such as the TIM barrel and the G3P dehydrogenase fold, are much more prevalent in the transcriptome than the genome, whereas others, such as the protein-kinase and leucine-zipper folds, are depleted. The TIM barrel, in fact, is overwhelmingly the 'top fold' in the transcriptome, while it only ranks fifth in the genome. The most highly enriched functional categories in the transcriptome (based on the MIPS system) are energy production and protein synthesis, while categories such as transcription, transport and signaling ave depleted. Furthermore, for a given functional category, transcriptome enrichment varies quite substantially between the different expression data sets, with a variation an order of magnitude larger than for the other categories cross-referenced (e.g. amino acids). One can readily see how the enrichment and depletion of the various functional categories relates directly to that of particular folds.

The Rsv phenotype was the result of a mutation that led to severalfold higher levels of the functionally and structurally related StpA protein. This mutation was a base pair change in the stpA structural gene, and the amino acid substitution in the StpA protein altered its turnover properties, suggesting a role for this residue in a cleavage site for proteolysis, We determined the stability of the StpA and the II-NS proteins and found that the StpA protein was degraded relatively rapidly in strains lacking functional N-NS, whereas H-NS remained stable irrespective of the presence/absence of StpA, Using protease-deficient mutants, we obtained evidence that the Lon protease was responsible fur the degradation of StpA. The differential turnover of the nucleoid-associated proteins is suggested to contribute to the regulation of their stoichiometry and ratio in terms of homo- and heteromer formation. We conclude that StpA, in contrast to H-NS, is present mainly in heteromeric form in \emph{{E}.~coli}.},

  Abstract                 = {Our understanding of the accuracy of {tRNA} selection on the messenger RNA programmed ribosome has recently increased dramatically because of high-resolution crystal structures of the ribosome, cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of its functional complexes, and fast kinetics experiments. Application of single-molecule spectroscopy with fluorescence resonance energy transfer to studies of {tRNA} selection by the ribosome has also provided new, albeit controversial, insights. Interestingly, when the fundamental trade-off between rate and accuracy in substrate-selective biosynthetic reactions is taken into account, some aspects of the current models of ribosome function appear strikingly suboptimal in the context of growing bacterial cells.},

  Abstract                 = {B chromosomes (Bs) can be described as 'passengers in the genome', a term that has been used for the repetitive DNA which comprises the bulk of the genome in large genome species, except that Bs have a life of their own as independent chromosomes. As with retrotransposons they can accumulate in number, but in this case by various processes of mitotic or meiotic drive, based on their own autonomous ways of using spindles, especially in the game-tophyte phase of the life cycle of flowering plants. This selfish property of drive ensures their survival and spread in natural populations, even against a gradient of harmful effects on the host plant phenotype. Bs are inhabitants of the nucleus and they are subject to control by 'genes' in the A chromosome (As) complement. This interaction with the As, together with the balance between drive and harmful effects makes a dynamic system in the life of a B chromosome, notwithstanding the fact that we are only now beginning to unravel the story in a few favoured species. In this review we concentrate mainly on recent developments in the Bs of rye and maize, two of the species currently receiving most attention. We focus on their population dynamics and on the molecular basis of their structural organisation and mechanisms of drive, as well as on their mode of origin and potential applications in plant biotechnology.

  Abstract                 = {Background: Locomotion is an integral component of most animal behaviors, and many human health problems are associated with locomotor deficits. Locomotor behavior is a complex trait, with population variation attributable to many interacting loci with small effects that are sensitive to environmental conditions. However, the genetic basis of this complex behavior is largely uncharacterized. Results: We quantified locomotor behavior of Drosophila melanogaster in a large population of inbred lines derived from a single natural population, and derived replicated selection lines with different levels of locomotion. Estimates of broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities were 0.52 and 0.16, respectively, indicating substantial non-additive genetic variance for locomotor behavior. We used whole genome expression analysis to identify 1,790 probe sets with different expression levels between the selection lines when pooled across replicates, at a false discovery rate of 0.001. The transcriptional responses to selection for locomotor, aggressive and mating behavior from the same base population were highly overlapping, but the magnitude of the expression differences between selection lines for increased and decreased levels of behavior was uncorrelated. We assessed the locomotor behavior of ten mutations in candidate genes with altered transcript abundance between selection lines, and identified seven novel genes affecting this trait. Conclusion: Expression profiling of genetically divergent lines is an effective strategy for identifying genes affecting complex behaviors, and reveals that a large number of pleiotropic genes exhibit correlated transcriptional responses to multiple behaviors. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a method for high-resolution genetic mapping that takes advantage of the ordered set of viable gene deletion mutants, which form a set of colinear markers covering almost every centimorgan of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, and of the synthetic genetic array (SGA) system, which automates the construction of double mutants formed by mating and meiotic recombination. The Cbk1 kinase signaling pathway, which consists minimally of CBK1, MOB2, KIC1, HYM1, and TAO3 (PAG1), controls polarized morphogenesis and activation of the Ace2 transcription factor. Deletion mutations in the Cbk1 pathway genes are tolerated differently by common laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae, being viable in the W303 background but dead in the S288C background. Genetic analysis indicated that the lethality of Cbk1 pathway deletions in the S288C background was suppressed by a single allele specific to the W303 background. SGA mapping (SGAM) was used to locate this W303-specific suppressor to the SSD1 locus, which contains a known polymorphism that appears to compromise SSD1 function. This procedure should map any mutation, dominant or recessive, whose phenotype is epistatic to wild type, that is, a phenotype that can be scored from a mixed population of cells obtained by germination of both mutant and wild-type spores. In principle, SGAM should be applicable to the analysis of multigenic traits. Large-scale construction of ordered mutations in other model organisms would broaden the application of this approach. },

  Abstract                 = {Fitting nonlinear models to time-series is a technique of increasing importance in population ecology. In this article, we apply it to assess the importance of predator dependence in the predation process by comparing two alternative models of equal complexity (one with and one without predator dependence) to predator-prey time-series. Stochasticities in such data come from both observation error and process error. We consider how these errors must be taken into account in the fitting process, and we develop eight different model selection criteria. Applying these criteria to laboratory data on simple protozoan and arthropod predator-prey systems shows that little predator dependence is present, with one interesting exception. Field data are more ambiguous (either selection depends on the particular criterion or no significant differences can be detected), and we show that both models fit reasonably well. We conclude that, within our modeling framework, predator dependence is in general insignificant in simple systems in homogeneous environments. Relatively complex systems show significant predator dependence more often than simple ones but the data are also often inconclusive. The analysis of such systems should rely on several models to detect predictions that are sensitive to predator dependence and to direct further research if necessary.},

  Abstract                 = {The complex structure of virus populations has been the object of intensive study in bacteria, animals, and plants for over a decade. While it is clear that tremendous genetic diversity is rapidly generated during viral replication, the distribution of this diversity within a single host remains an obscure area in this field of science. Among animal viruses, only Human immunodeficiency virus and Hepatitis C virus populations have recently been thoroughly investigated at an intrahost level, where they are structured as metapopulations, demonstrating that the host cannot be considered simply as a "bag" containing a homogeneous or unstructured swarm of mutant viral genomes. In plants, a few reports suggested a possible heterogeneous distribution of virus variants at different locations within the host but provided no clues as to how this heterogeneity is structured. Here, we report the most exhaustive study of the structure and evolution of a virus population ever reported at the intrahost level through the analysis of a Prunus tree infected by Plum pox virus for over 13 years following a single inoculation event and by using analysis of molecular variance at different hierarchical levels combined with nested clade analysis. We demonstrate that, following systemic invasion of the host, the virus population differentiates into several distinct populations that are isolated in different branches, where they evolve independently through contiguous range expansion while colonizing newly formed organs. Moreover, we present and discuss evidence that the tree harbors a huge "bank" of viral clones, each isolated in one of the myriad leaves.},

  Abstract                 = {While pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) is almost exclusively caused by cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) mutations, many patients identified with the PSACH phenotype do not have this mutation, suggesting gene and locus heterogeneity. In order to further characterize this entity, we studied 32 clinically and radiographically diagnosed PSACH patients, among 19 families. COMP and collagen (Col) IX (A1, A2 and A3) mutations, were determined. Patients who tested negative for pathological gene mutations but who were identified with the PSACH phenotype, were included. The phenotypes were characterized according to height deviation (cm) from normal, lower extremity mechanical axis deviation (MAD), cervical and thoracolumbar spine involvement, pelvic index, as well as hip, knee, ankle and hand involvement. We report an 81\% mutation detection rate for PSACH, of which COMP+Col9A3 mutations were more prevalent (61\%) than COMP mutations alone (30\%). Of our PSACH patients, 19\% tested negative for both COMP and Col9A3 mutations, and they presented with the greatest mean height deviations, but the least mean MADs. While all the PSACH mutations consistently produced the severe phenotype, the V426A mutation in Col9A3 produced the most severe. Mother-daughter and father-son phenotypic similarities were noted in the COMP+Col9A3 families. Col9A3 and gender play confounding roles in the phenotypic severity of PSACH. The presence of the PSACH phenotype in patients who tested negative for known mutations further confirms the genetic heterogeneity of this condition. },

  Abstract                 = {A key question in molecular genetics is why severe mutations often do not result in a detectably abnormal phenotype. This robustness was partially ascribed to redundant paralogs(1,2) that may provide backup for one another in case of mutation. Mining mutant viability and {mRNA} expression data in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that backup was provided predominantly by paralogs that are expressed dissimilarly in most growth conditions. We considered that this apparent inconsistency might be resolved by a transcriptional reprogramming mechanism that allows the intact paralog to rescue the organism upon mutation of its counterpart. We found that in wild-type cells, partial coregulation across growth conditions predicted the ability of paralogs to alter their transcription patterns and to provide backup for one another. Notably, the sets of regulatory motifs that controlled the paralogs with the most efficient backup activity deliberately overlapped only partially; paralogs with highly similar or dissimilar sets of motifs had suboptimal backup activity. Such an arrangement of partially shared regulatory motifs reconciles the differential expression of paralogs with their ability to back each other up. },

This is also accompanied by the strategic location of codon pairs in coherence to mRNA secondary structure folding stability for the above mentioned combinations of tRNA isoacceptors.

  Abstract                 = {Biased usage of synonymous codons has been elucidated under the perspective of cellular tRNA abundance for quite a long time now. Taking advantage of publicly available gene expression data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a systematic analysis of the codon and amino acid usages in two different coding regions corresponding to the regular (helix and strand) as well as the irregular (coil) protein secondary structures, have been performed. Our analyses suggest that apart from tRNA abundance, mRNA folding stability is another major evolutionary force in shaping the codon and amino acid usage differences between the highly and lowly expressed genes in S. cerevisiae genome and surprisingly it depends on the coding regions corresponding to the secondary structures of the encoded proteins. This is obviously a new paradigm in understanding the codon usage in S. cerevisiae. Differential amino acid usage between highly and lowly expressed genes in the regions coding for the irregular protein secondary structure in S. cerevisiae is expounded by the stability of the mRNA folded structure. Irrespective of the protein secondary structural type, the highly expressed genes always tend to encode cheaper amino acids in order to reduce the overall biosynthetic cost of production of the corresponding protein. This study supports the hypothesis that the tRNA abundance is a consequence of and not a reason for the biased usage of amino acid between highly and lowly expressed genes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here we describe the use of RNA interference to inhibit the function of similar to86\% of the 19,427 predicted genes of C. elegans. We identified mutant phenotypes for 1,722 genes, about two-thirds of which were not previously associated with a phenotype. We find that genes of similar functions are clustered in distinct, multi-megabase regions of individual chromosomes; genes in these regions tend to share transcriptional profiles. Our resulting data set and reusable RNAi library of 16,757 bacterial clones will facilitate systematic analyses of the connections among gene sequence, chromosomal location and gene function in C. elegans. },

Optimal codons for translation were predicted on the basis of {tRNA}-gene copy numbers. Highly expressed genes, such as those encoding ribosomal proteins and histones in S. pombe, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster have biased patterns of codon usage which have been observed in a wide range of unicellular organisms. In S. pombe and C elegans, codons contributing positively to the principal component with the largest variance (Z(1)-parameter) corresponded to the optimal codons which were predicted on the basis of {tRNA} gene numbers. In D. melanogaster, this correlation was less evident, and the codons contributing positively to the Z(1)-parameter corresponded primarily to codons with a C or G in the codon third position. In X. laevis and H. sapiens, codon usage in the genes encoding ribosomal proteins and histones was not significantly biased, suggesting that the primary factor influencing codon-usage diversity in these species is not translation efficiency. Codon-usage diversity in these species is known to reflect primarily isochore structures. In the present study, the second additional factor was explained by the level of use of codons containing CG-dinucleotides, and this is discussed with respect to transcription regulation via methylation of CG-dinucleotides, which is observed in mammalian genomes.},

Individual {tRNA} levels were proportional to the copy number of the respective {tRNA} genes. This indicates that the {tRNA} gene copy number is an important factor to determine in cellular {tRNA} levels, which is common with \emph{Escherichia coli} and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Codon usage in 18 unicellular organisms whose genomes have been sequenced completely was analyzed and compared with the composition of {tRNA} genes.

Codons preferred in highly expressed genes were related to the codons optimal for the translation process, which were predicted by the composition of isoaccepting {tRNA} genes. Genes with specific codon usage are discussed in connection with their evolutionary origins and functions. The origin and terminus of replication could be predicted on the basis of codon usage when the usage was analyzed relative to the transcription direction of individual genes.

  Abstract                 = {The concepts of adaptive/fitness landscapes and adaptive peaks are a central pail of much of contemporary evolutionary biology; the concepts are introduced in introductory texts, developed in more detail in graduate-level treatments, and are used extensively in papers published in the major journals in the field. The appeal of visualizing the process of evolution in terms of the movement of populations oil such landscapes is very strong; as one becomes familiar with the metaphor, one often develops the feeling that it is possible to gain deep insights into evolution by thinking about the movement of populations on landscapes consisting of adaptive valleys and peaks. But, since Wright first introduced the metaphor in 1932, the metaphor has been the subject of persistent confusion, from equivocation over just what the features of the landscape are meant to represent to how we ought to expect the landscapes to look. Recent advances-conceptual, empirical, and computational-have pointed towards the inadequacy and indeed incoherence of the landscapes as usually pictured. I argue that attempts to reform the metaphor are misguided; it is time to give up the pictorial metaphor of the landscape entirely and rely instead on the results of formal modeling, however difficult such results are to understand in 'intuitive' terms. },

  Abstract                 = {Trinucleotide hereditary diseases such as Huntington disease and Friedreich ataxia are cureless diseases associated with inheriting an abnormally large number of DNA trinucleotide repeats in a gene. The genes associated with different diseases are unrelated and harbor a trinucleotide repeat in different functional regions; therefore, it is striking that many of these diseases have similar correlations between their genotype, namely the number of inherited repeats and age of onset and progression phenotype. These correlations remain unexplained despite more than a decade of research. Although mechanisms have been proposed for several trinucleotide diseases, none of the proposals, being disease-specific, can account for the commonalities among these diseases. Here, we propose a universal mechanism in which length-dependent somatic repeat expansion occurs during the patient's lifetime toward a pathological threshold. Our mechanism uniformly explains for the first time to our knowledge the genotype phenotype correlations common to trinucleotide disease and is well-supported by both experimental and clinical data. In addition, mathematical analysis of the mechanism provides simple explanations to a wide range of phenomena such as the exponential decrease of the age-of-onset curve, similar onset but faster progression in patients with Huntington disease with homozygous versus heterozygous mutation, and correlation of age of onset with length of the short allele but not with the long allele in Friedreich ataxia. If our proposed universal mechanism proves to be the core component of the actual mechanisms of specific trinucleotide diseases, it would open the search for a uniform treatment for all these diseases, possibly by delaying the somatic expansion process. },

For example, the cagA domain of Helicobacter pylori is highly deviant in its genome signature and codon bias from the rest of the genome. Using these methods we can detect two potential PAIs in the Neisseria meningitidis genome, which contain hemagglutinin and/or hemolysin-related genes. Additionally, G+C variation and genome signature differences of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome indicate two pA gene clusters. },

Three of these genomes, SINME, AGRTU, and BRUME, contain multiple chromosomes or megaplasmids (>1 Mb length). PHX genes in these genomes are concentrated mainly in the major (largest) chromosome with few PHX genes found in the secondary chromosomes and megaplasmids. Tricarboxylic acid cycle and aerobic respiration genes are strongly PHX in all five genomes, whereas anaerobic pathways of glycolysis and fermentation are mostly not PHX. Only in MESLO (but not SINME) and BRUME are most glycolysis genes PHX Many flagellar genes are PHX in MESLO and CAUCR, but mostly are not PHX in SINME and AGRTU. The nonmotile BRUME also carries many flagellar genes but these are generally not PHX and all but one are located in the second chromosome.

  Abstract                 = {Bacterial, archaeal, yeast, and fly genomes are compared with respect to predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes and several genomic properties. There is a striking difference in the status of PHX ribosomal protein (RP) genes where the archaeal genome generally encodes more RP genes and fewer PHX RPs compared with bacterial genomes. The increase in RPs in archaea and eukaryotes compared with that in bacteria may reflect a more complex set of interactions in archaea and eukaryotes in regulating translation, e.g., differences in structure requiring scaffolding of longer rRNA molecules, expanded interactions with the chaperone machinery, and, in eukaryotic interactions with endoplasmic reticulum components. The yeast genome is similar to fast-growing bacteria in PHX genes but also features several cytoskeletal genes, including actin and tropomyosin, and several signal transduction regulatory proteins from the 14.3.3 family. The most PHX genes of Drosophila encode cytoskeletal and exoskeletal proteins. We found that the preference of a microorganism for an anaerobic metabolism correlates with the number of PHX enzymes of the glycolysis pathway that well exceeds the number of PHX enzymes acting in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Conversely, if the number of PHX enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle well exceeds the PHX enzymes of glycolysis, an aerobic metabolism is preferred. Where the numbers are approximately commensurate, a facultative growth behavior prevails.}

  Abstract                 = {Synonymous codon usage is biased and the bias seems to be different in different organisms. Factors with proposed roles in causing codon bias include degree and timing of gene expression, codon-anticodon interactions, transcription and translation rate and fidelity, codon context, and global and local G+C content. We offer a new perspective and new methods for elucidating codon choices applied especially to the human genome. We present data supporting the thesis that codon choices for human genes are largely a consequence of two factors: (1) amino acid constraints, (2) maintaining DNA structures dependent on base-step conformational tendencies consistent with the organism's genome signature that is determined by genome-wide processes of DNA modification, replication and repair. The related codon signature defined as the dinucleotide relative abundances at the distinct codon positions {1, 2}, {2, 3}, and {3, 4} (4 = 1 of the next codon) accommodates both the global genome signature and amino acid constraints. In human genes, codon positions {2, 3} and {3, 4} containing the silent site have similar codon signatures reflecting DNA symmetry. Strong CG and TA dinucleotide underrepresentation is observed at all codon positions as well as in non-coding regions. Estimates of synonymous codon usage based on codon signatures are in excellent agreement with the actual codon usage in human and general vertebrate genes. These properties are largely independent of the isochore compartment (G + C content),gene size, and transcriptional and translational constraints. We hypothesize that major influences on codon usage in human genes result from residue preferences and diresidue associations in proteins coupled to biases on the DNA level, related to replication and repair processes and/or DNA structural requirements.

In prokaryotic genomes, genes that deviate strongly in codon usage from the average gene but are sufficiently similar in codon usage to ribosomal protein genes, to translation and transcription processing factors, and to chaperone-degradation proteins are predicted highly expressed (PHX). By these criteria, PHX genes in most prokaryotic genomes include those encoding ribosomal proteins, translation and transcription processing factors, and chaperone proteins and genes of principal energy metabolism. In particular, for the fast-growing species Escherichia call, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, major glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes are PHX. In Synechocystis, prime genes of photosynthesis are PHX, and in methanogens, PHX genes include those essential for methanogenesis. Overall, the three protein families-ribosomal proteins, protein synthesis factors, and chaperone complexes-are needed at many stages of the life cycle, and apparently bacteria have evolved codon usage to maintain appropriate growth, stability, and plasticity. New interpretations of the capacity of Deinococcus radiodurans for resistance to high doses of ionizing radiation is based on an excess of PHX chaperone-degradation genes and detoxification genes. Expression levels of selected classes of genes, including those for flagella, electron transport, detoxification, histidine kinases, and others, are analyzed. Flagellar PHX genes are conspicuous among spirochete genomes. PHX genes are positively correlated with strong Shine-Dalgarno signal sequences. Specific regulatory proteins, e.g., two-component sensor proteins, are rarely PHX. Genes involved in pathways for the synthesis of vitamins record low predicted expression levels. Several distinctive PHX genes of the available complete prokaryotic genomes are highlighted. Relationships of PHX genes with stoichiometry, multifunctionality, and operon structures are discussed. Our methodology may be used complementary to experimental expression analysis. },

Our approach to ascertaining gene expression levels relates to codon usage differences among certain gene classes: the collection of all genes (average gene), the ensemble of ribosomal protein genes, major translation/transcription processing factors, and genes for polypeptides of chaperone/degradation complexes. A gene is predicted highly expressed (PHX) if its codon frequencies are close to those of the ribosomal proteins, major translation/transcription processing factor, and chaperone/degradation standards but strongly deviant from the average gene codon frequencies. PHX genes identified by their codon usage frequencies among prokaryotic genomes commonly include those for ribosomal proteins, major transcription/translation processing factors (several occurring in multiple copies), and major chaperone/degradation proteins. Also PHX genes generally include those encoding enzymes of essential energy metabolism pathways of glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and respiration (aerobic and anaerobic), genes of fatty acid biosynthesis, and the principal genes of amino acid and nucleotide biosyntheses. Gene classes generally not PHX include most repair protein genes, virtually all vitamin biosynthesis genes, genes of two-component sensor systems, most regulatory genes, and most genes expressed in stationary phase or during starvation. Members of the set of PHX aminoacyl-{tRNA} synthetase genes contrast sharply between genomes. There are also subtle differences among the PHX energy metabolism genes between E. coli and B. subtilis, particularly with respect to genes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The good agreement of PHX genes of E. coli and B. subtilis with high protein abundances, as assessed by two-dimensional gel determination, is verified. Relationships of PHX genes with stoichiometry, multifunctionality, and operon structures are also examined. The spatial distribution of PHX genes within each genome reveals clusters and significantly long regions without PHX genes. }

  Abstract                 = {A new measure for assessing codon bias of one group of genes with respect to a second group of genes is introduced, In this formulation, codon bias correlations for \emph{Escherichia coli} genes are evaluated for level of expression, for contrasts along genes, for genes in different 200 kb (or longer) contigs around the genome, for effects of gene size, for variation over different function classes, for codon bias in relation to possible lateral transfer and for dicodon bias for some gene classes, Among the function classes, codon biases of ribosomal proteins are the most deviant from the codon frequencies of the average E, coli gene, Other classes of 'highly expressed genes' (e,g, amino acyl {tRNA} synthetases, chaperonins, modification genes essential to translation activities) show less extreme codon biases, Consistently for genes with experimentally determined expression rates in the exponential growth phase, those of highest molar abundances are more deviant from the average gene codon frequencies and are more similar in codon frequencies to the average ribosomal protein gene, Independent of gene size, the codon biases in the 5' third of genes deviate by more than a factor of two from those in the middle and 3' thirds. In this context, there appear to be conflicting selection pressures imposed by the constraints of ribosomal binding, or more generally the early phase of protein synthesis (about the first 50 codons) may be more biased than the complete nascent polypeptide. In partitioning the E. coli genome into 10 equal lengths, pronounced differences in codon site 3 G+C frequencies accumulate, Genes near to oriC have 5\% greater codon site 3 G+C frequencies than do genes from the ter region, This difference also is observed between small (100-300 codons) and large (>800 codons) genes. This result contrasts with that for eukaryotic genomes (including human, Caenorhabditis elegans and yeast) where long genes tend to have site 3 more AT rich than short genes. Many of the above results are special for E, coli genes and do not apply to genes of most bacterial genomes, A gene is defined as alien (possibly horizontally transferred) if its codon bias relative to the average gene exceeds a high threshold and the codon bias relative to ribosomal proteins is also appropriately high, These ave identified, including four clusters (operons), The bulk of these genes have no known function.}

Recent advances include the application of RNA interference methods to characterize loss-of-function phenotype genes in higher eukaryotes, comparative analysis of the human and mouse genome sequences, and methods for reconciling contradictory phylogenetic reconstructions. New developments feed into the increasingly rich content of databases such as the COG database. The next phase of research will be increasingly dominated by efforts to integrate the deluge of data into our understanding of biological systems.}

  Abstract                 = {Based primarily on 16S rRNA sequence comparisons, life has been broadly divided into the three domains of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Archaea is further classified into Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea. Archaea generally thrive in extreme environments as assessed by temperature, pH, and salinity. For many prokaryotic organisms, ribosomal proteins (RP), transcription/translation factors, and chaperone genes tend to be highly expressed. A gene is predicted highly expressed (PHX) if its codon usage is rather similar to the average codon usage of at least one of the RP, transcription/translation factors, and chaperone gene classes and deviates strongly from the average gene of the genome. The thermosome (Ths) chaperonin family represents the most salient PHX genes among Archaea. The chaperones Trigger factor and HSP70 have overlapping functions in the folding process, but both of these proteins are lacking in most archaea where they may be substituted by the chaperone prefoldin. Other distinctive PHX proteins of Archaea, absent from Bacteria, include the proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA, a replication auxiliary factor responsible for tethering the catalytic unit of DNA polymerase to DNA during highspeed replication, and the acidic RP P-0, which helps to initiate {mRNA} translation at the ribosome. Other PHX genes feature Cell division control protein 48 (Cdc48), whereas the bacterial septation proteins FtsZ and minD are lacking in Crenarchaea. RadA is a major DNA repair and recombination protein of Archaea. Archaeal genomes feature a strong Shine-Dalgarno ribosome-binding motif more pronounced in Euryarchaea compared with Crenarchaea. }

Most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are PHX in these genomes, but not those involved in the TCA cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. Only B. subtilis and B. halodurans have several TCA cycle PHX genes, whereas the TCA pathway is entirely missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two Streptococcus species and is incomplete in Listeria, Lactococcus, and Clostridium. Pyruvate-formate lyase, an enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest PHX genes in all these genomes except for C. acetobutylicum (not PHX), and B. subtilis, and B. halodurans (missing). Pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently PHX in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. Phosphotransferase system genes are generally PHX with selection of different substrates in different genomes. The various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources. }

  Abstract                 = {Gene duplication is thought to play the singular most important role in the formation of novel genes. The canonical model of gene duplication postulates that novel genes arise in a two-step fashion, namely, (1) the complete duplication of a gene followed by (2) the gradual accumulation of mutations in one or both copies leading to an altered function. It was previously demonstrated that more than 50\% of newborn duplicates in Caenorhabditis elegans had unique exons in one or both members of a duplicate pair, indicating that many duplicates are not functionally identical to the progenitor copy at birth. Both partial and chimeric gene duplications contribute to the formation of novel genes. For chimeric duplications, the genomic sources of unique exons are diverse, including genic and intergenic regions, as well as repetitive elements. These novel genes derived from partial and chimeric duplications are equally likely to be transcriptionally active as copies derived from complete duplications of the ancestral gene. Duplication breakpoints in the ancestral copies are uniformly distributed in the genome, ruling out the role of any mechanism that restricts them to a particular type of sequence such as introns. Finally, both intron loss and gain contribute to the differential distribution of introns between two copies. },

The current generation of stochastic models overestimates the observed critical community size for measles, generating much less persistence of infection than is observed. The inclusion of a more biologically realistic model for the duration of infection produced a much closer fit to the actual critical community size and explains previously undescribed high-frequency oscillations in measles incidence. },

The two karyotypes differ by one chromosome fusion, nine pericentric inversions, and various additions of heterochromatin to chromosomal telomeres. Only the fusion, which gave rise to human chromosome 2, has been characterized at the sequence level. During the present study, we investigated the pericentric inversion by which chimpanzee chromosome 19 differs from human chromosome 17. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to identify breakpoint-spanning bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and plasmid artificial chromosomes (PACs). By sequencing the junction fragments, we localized breakpoints in intergenic regions rich in repetitive elements. Our findings suggest that repeat-mediated nonhomologous recombination has facilitated inversion formation. No addition or deletion of any sequence element was detected at the breakpoints or in the surrounding sequences. Next to the break, at a distance of 10.2-39.1 kb, the following genes were found: NGFR and NXPH3 (on human chromosome 17q21.3) and GUC2D and ALOX15B (on human chromosome 17p13). The inversion affects neither the genomic structure nor the gene-activity state with regard to replication timing of these genes.}

  Abstract                 = {The human mutation rate per nucleotide site per generation (mu) can be estimated from data on mutation rates at loci causing Mendelian genetic disease, by comparing putatively neutrally evolving nucleotide sequences between humans and chimpanzees and by comparing the genome sequences of relatives. Direct estimates from genome sequencing of relatives suggest that mu is about 1.1 x 10(-8), which is about twofold lower than estimates based on the human-chimp divergence. This implies that an average of similar to 70 new mutations arise in the human diploid genome per generation. Most of these mutations are paternal in origin, but the male: female mutation rate ratio is currently uncertain and might vary even among individuals within a population. On the basis of a method proposed by Kondrashov and Crow, the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate (U) can be estimated from the product of the number of nucleotide sites in the genome, mu, and the mean selective constraint per site. Although the presence of many weakly selected mutations in human noncoding DNA makes this approach somewhat problematic, estimates are U approximate to 2.2 for the whole diploid genome per generation and similar to 0.35 for mutations that change an amino acid of a protein-coding gene. A genome-wide deleterious mutation rate of 2.2 seems higher than humans could tolerate if natural selection is "hard," but could be tolerated if selection acts on relative fitness differences between individuals or if there is synergistic epistasis. I argue that in the foreseeable future, an accumulation of new deleterious mutations is unlikely to lead to a detectable decline in fitness of human populations.},

Properties of the DFE can be inferred by comparing the distributions of the frequencies of segregating nucleotide polymorphisms at selected and neutral sites in a population sample, but demographic changes alter the spectrum for. We have developed a maximum-likelihood approach, based on the expected allele-frequency distribution generated by transition matrix methods, to estimate parameters of the DFE while simultaneously estimating parameters of a demographic model that allows a populations size change at some time in the past. We tested the method using simulations and found that it accurately recovers simulated parameters values, even if the simulated demography differs substantially from that assumed in our analysis. We use our method to estimate parameters of the DFE for amino acid-changing mutations in humans and Drosophila melanogaster. For a model of unconditionally deleterious mutations, with effects sampled from a gamma distribution, the mean estimate for the distribution shape parameter is similar to 0.2 for human populations, which implies that the DFE is strongly leptokurtic. For Drosophila populations, we estimate that the shape parameter is similar to 0.35. Differences in the shape of the distribution and the mean selection coefficient between humans and Drosophila result in significantly more strongly deleterious mutations in Drosophila than in humans, and, conversely, nearly neutral mutations are significantly less frequent.},

Heritabilities derived from midparent-offspring regressions were all high and significantly different from zero. Removing all extra-pair young from the data set increased father-offspring regressions by an average of 21\%, but mother-offspring resemblance still exceeded father-offspring resemblance by up to 42\%.

  Abstract                 = {Given that natural selection is so powerful at optimizing complex adaptations, why does it seem unable to eliminate genes (susceptibility alleles) that predispose to common, harmful, heritable mental disorders, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? We assess three leading explanations for this apparent paradox from evolutionary genetic theory: (1) ancestral neutrality (susceptibility alleles were not harmful among ancestors), (2) balancing selection (susceptibility alleles sometimes increased fitness), and (3) polygenic mutation-selection balance (mental disorders reflect the inevitable mutational load on the thousands of genes underlying human behavior). The first two explanations are commonly assumed in psychiatric genetics and Darwinian psychiatry, while mutation-selection has often been discounted. All three models can explain persistent genetic variance in some traits under some conditions, but the first two have serious problems in explaining human mental disorders. Ancestral neutrality fails to explain low mental disorder frequencies and requires implausibly small selection coefficients against mental disorders given the data on the reproductive costs and impairment of mental disorders. Balancing selection (including spatio-temporal variation in selection, heterozygote advantage, antagonistic pleiotropy, and frequency-dependent selection) tends to favor environmentally contingent adaptations (which would show no heritability) or high-frequency alleles (which psychiatric genetics would have already found). Only polygenic mutation-selection balance seems consistent with the data on mental disorder prevalence rates, fitness costs, the likely rarity of susceptibility alleles, and the increased risks of mental disorders with brain trauma, inbreeding, and paternal age. This evolutionary genetic framework for mental disorders has wide-ranging implications for psychology, psychiatry, behavior genetics, molecular genetics, and evolutionary approaches to studying human behavior. },

We estimate that the odds of schizophrenia increase by similar to 17\% for every 1\% increase in genome-wide autozygosity. This association is not due to one or a few regions, but results from many autozygous segments spread throughout the genome, and is consistent with a role for multiple recessive or partially recessive alleles in the etiology of schizophrenia. Such a bias towards recessivity suggests that alleles that increase the risk of schizophrenia have been selected against over evolutionary time. },

  Abstract                 = {Identifying the functional elements encoded in a genome is one of the principal challenges in modern biology. Comparative genomics should offer a powerful, general approach. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on high-quality draft sequences of three related species (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus). We first aligned the genomes and characterized their evolution, defining the regions and mechanisms of change. We then developed methods for direct identification of genes and regulatory motifs. The gene analysis yielded a major revision to the yeast gene catalogue, affecting approximately 15\% of all genes and reducing the total count by about 500 genes. The motif analysis automatically identified 72 genome-wide elements, including most known regulatory motifs and numerous new motifs. We inferred a putative function for most of these motifs, and provided insights into their combinatorial interactions. The results have implications for genome analysis of diverse organisms, including the human. },

  Abstract                 = {In the resurging field of RNA modifications, quantification is a bottleneck blocking many exciting avenues. With currently over 150 known nucleoside alterations, detection and quantification methods must encompass multiple modifications for a comprehensive profile. LC-MS/MS approaches offer a perspective for comprehensive parallel quantification of all the various modifications found in total RNA of a given organism. By feeding C-13-glucose as sole carbon source, we have generated a stable isotope-labeled internal standard (SIL-IS) for bacterial RNA, which facilitates relative comparison of all modifications. While conventional SIL-IS approaches require the chemical synthesis of single modifications in weighable quantities, this SIL-IS consists of a nucleoside mixture covering all detectable RNA modifications of Escherichia coli, yet in small and initially unknown quantities. For absolute in addition to relative quantification, those quantities were determined by a combination of external calibration and sample spiking of the biosynthetic SIL-IS. For each nucleoside, we thus obtained a very robust relative response factor, which permits direct conversion of the MS signal to absolute amounts of substance. The application of the validated SIL-IS allowed highly precise quantification with standard deviations <2\% during a 12-week period, and a linear dynamic range that was extended by two orders of magnitude.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that this variation is caused by deleterious mutations maintained through mutation-selection balance. The deleterious-mutation model predicts that rare, partially recessive alleles will be the primary source of variation. We test this prediction by measuring the change in the mean Bower size (DeltaM) and the directional dominance of Bower size (DeltaB) within a selection experiment. If variation is due to rare (partially) recessive alleles, DeltaB/DeltaM is expected to be positive and exceed one. However, we obtain negative values for DeltaB/DeltaM from three independent selection lines. This result is statistically inconsistent with the deleterious-mutation model. },

  Abstract                 = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative importance of various potential causes of the cycles, Over the past three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles, using both long-term population time series and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics, We finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using modern statistical techniques, Finally, we compare simulated time series generated by the models to the observed time series, using a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively as "probes." The model most similar to the data, as measured by these probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in which we know the "true" governing mechanism. Our analysis, which uses only a subset of the information available about the population, uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach might be successfully applied to field populations as well. }

Assume only one disease and that its the only source of mortality. Model: Constant-- Define model, do a stability analysis about equilibrium and show that they are generally stable, potentially oscillatory. They then explore five special cases (no imm. , no births, disease fatal, etc). Results are summarized in Table I Variable rates: allow recovery, added mort, etc to vary with age of an infection. Results are summarized in Table II. Discussion:In general the find that there can be at most one steady state. If these open populations exceed the threshold, then a certain proportion will become sick, but that number will not be as large as the total amount the population exceeds the threshold (why? I don't know) although the disease rate (i.e. the rate of disease spread?) will be proportional to the excess when the excess is small. Equilibriums can be stable or unstable, but are generally stable in the cases with constant rates.}

The disease spreads from the affect to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs thorugh the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or death\ldots One of the most import. problems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susecptible ind. are left or \ldots whilst many suscept. ind. are still present in the unaffected pop." Define threshold density for disease spread w/in a pop. "It will appear also that the size of the epidemic increases rapidly as the threshold density is eceeded, and in such a manner that the greater the pop. density at the beginning of the epidemic, the smaller it will be at the end of the epidemic." This is b/c the epidemic will continue to grow so long as the density of suscept. is above the threshold. Interestingly they say that two reasons often given for the "termination of an epidemic" is the loss of ALL susceptibles or "the virulence of the causative organism has gradually decreased." They then say neither view is supported. Models: Start with a discrete time model where host population is structured by the age of the infection. Cool. For simplicity and b/c they are not interested in a growing pop. they lump dead and recovered together. They then take the limit of their time unit going to 0 and get the continous time version with survivorship of the original infected cohort as a function of $\exp[\int_0^t \psi(a) da]$. In general this is a very humbling paper. Lots of math and Laplace transforms, etc. Specific Case: Constant characteristic rates. Getting to the biology they note that if the population is initially equal to $N_T + n$ then the total number of infected hosts that become infected is equal to $2 n - 2 n^2/N $ such that in the end if $n\ll N$, then, $N(\infty) \approx N_T - n$. General Case: Varying characteristic rates. Essentially the same results in terms of $N(\infty)$ They also discuss how a change in infectivity (i.e. transmission coefficient) can lead to an epidemic as well if the host population is at the threshold density. They then make a quick step to indirectly transmitted diseases (plague, malaria) and argue that if $N_v N_h > N_T_v N_T_h$ then an epidemic will occur. They end by discussing how "in many regions of the world the acutall density of a population may not be widely different from the threshold density with regard to some dominant contagious disease." 3/01}

This effect is mediated by a bridging complex, composed of the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), eIF4G, and the cap binding protein, eIF4E. PABP-interacting protein 1 (Paip1) is another factor that interacts with PABP to coactivate translation. Here, we describe a novel human PABP-interacting protein (Paip2), which acts as a repressor of translation both \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in vivo}. Paip2 preferentially inhibits translation of a poly(A)-containing {mRNA}, but has no effect on the translation of hepatitis C virus {mRNA}, which is capand eIf4G-independent. Paip2 decreases the affinity of PABP for polyadenylate RNA, and disrupts the repeating structure of poly(A) ribonucleoprotein. Furthermore, Paip2 competes with Paip1 for PABP binding. Thus, Paip2 inhibits translation by interdicting PABP function. }

A markedly limited number of clonal parasite lineages have been recognized as predominating in North American and European populations, whereas strains from South America are comparatively diverse. Here, we show that strains from North America and Europe share distinct genetic polymorphisms that are mutually exclusive from polymorphisms in strains from the south. A striking exception to this geographic segregation is a monomorphic version of one chromosome (Chr1a) that characterizes virtually all northern and many southern isolates. Using a combination of molecular phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses, we conclude that northern and southern parasite populations diverged from a common ancestor in isolation over a period of approximately 10(6) yr, and that the monomorphic Chr1a has swept each population within the past 10,000 years. Like its definitive feline hosts, T. gondii may have entered South America and diversified there after reestablishment of the Panamanian land bridge. Since then, recombination has been an infrequent but important force in generating new T. gondii genotypes. Genes unique to a monomorphic version of a single parasite chromosome may have facilitated a recent population sweep of a limited number of highly successful T. gondii lineages.},

Our BCF is also cross-referenced, highlighting interconnections between concepts. We have found our BCF to be a versatile tool for design, evaluation, and revision of course goals and materials. There has been a call for creating Biology Concept Inventories, multiple-choice exams that test important biology concepts, analogous to those in physics, astronomy, and chemistry. We argue that the community of researchers and educators must first reach consensus about not only what concepts are important to test, but also how the concepts should be organized and how that organization might influence teaching and learning. We think that our BCF can serve as a catalyst for community-wide discussion on organizing the vast number of concepts in biology, as a model for others to formulate their own BCFs and as a contribution toward the creation of a comprehensive BCF.},

  Abstract                 = {In the present review, we summarized current knowledge on replicative strand asymmetries in prokaryotic genomes. A cornerstone for the creation of a theory of their formation has been overviewed. According to our recent works, the probability of nonsense mutation caused by replication-associated mutational pressure is higher for genes from lagging strands than for genes from leading strands of both bacterial and archaeal genomes. Lower density of open reading frames in lagging strands can be explained by faster rates of nonsense mutations in genes situated on them. According to the asymmetries in nucleotide usage in fourfold and twofold degenerate sites, the direction of replication-associated mutational pressure for genes from lagging strands is usually the same as the direction of transcription-associated mutational pressure. It means that lagging strands should accumulate more 8-oxo-G, uracil and 5-formyl-uracil, respectively. In our opinion, consequences of cytosine deamination (C to T transitions) do not lead to the decrease of cytosine usage in genes from lagging strands because of the consequences of thymine oxidation (T to C transitions), while guanine oxidation (causing G to T transversions) makes the main contribution into the decrease of guanine usage in fourfold degenerate sites of genes from lagging strands. Nucleotide usage asymmetries and bias in density of coding regions can be found in archaeal genomes, although, the percent of "inversed" asymmetries is much higher for them than for bacterial genomes. "Homogenized" and "inversed" replicative strand asymmetries in archaeal genomes can be used as retrospective indexes for detection of OriC translocations and large inversions.},

  Abstract                 = {The need to understand the genetic basis of drug resistance in human pathogens has never been greater. The global incidence of drug-resistant organisms, such as those that cause malaria, continues to rise, while the repertoire of effective, inexpensive drugs is declining. Genomic technologies, such as DNA microarrays and full-genome sequencing offer new hope in advancing our understanding of the underlying genetic processes that facilitate a resistance phenotype. Importantly, evidence that drug resistance in many organisms can be a multigene, complex phenomenon implies that unbiased, genome-wide scans of diversity will be required to fully understand the molecular mechanisms of both established and novel resistance traits. While the potential application of full-genome approaches for deciphering mechanisms of drug resistance has yet to be fully realized, this review evaluates drug resistance in human malaria parasites and discusses the exciting role genome-based systems could play in monitoring drug resistance, as well as guiding the implementation of efficient therapeutic strategies for malaria. The approaches reviewed within this article will be applicable to all known or emerging microbial pathogens. }

  Abstract                 = {Codon bias has been observed in many species. The usage of selective codons in a given gene is positively correlated with its expression efficiency. As an experimental approach to study codon-usage effects on heterologous gene expression in mammalian cells, we designed two human erythropoietin(EPO) genes, one in which native codons were systematically substituted with codons frequently found in highly expressed human genes and the other with codons prevalent in yeast genes. Relative performances of the re-engineered EPO genes were evaluated with various combinations of promoters and signal leader sequences. Under the comparable set of combinations, mature EPO gene with human high-frequency codons gave a considerably higher level of expression than that with yeast high-frequency codons. However, the levels of EPO expression varied, depending on the alternate combinations. Since the promoters and the signal leader sequences that we used are known to be equally efficient in gene expression, we hypothesized that the varied expression levels were due to the linear sequence between the promoter and the coding gene sequence. To test this possibility, we designed the EPO gene with hybrid codon usage in which the 5'-proximal region of the EPO gene was synthesized with yeast-biased codons and the rest with human-biased codons. This codon-usage hybrid EPO gene substantially enhanced the level of EPO transcripts and proteins up to 2.9-fold and 13.8-fold, respectively, when compared to the revel reached by the original counterpart. Our results suggest that the linear sequence between the promoter and the 5'-proximal region of a gene plays an important role in achieving high-level expression in mammalian cells.

  Abstract                 = {There is clear heritability of human longevity. However, the genetics of ageing is likely to be complex. Evolution theory tells us not to expect genes that have been selected to promote ageing. Ageing is not programmed but results from accumulation of somatic damage, owing to limited investments in maintenance and repair. Genes controlling the levels of activities, such as DNA repair and antioxidant defence, thus regulate longevity. In addition, there may be contributions either from late-acting deleterious genes that escape the force of natural selection or that trade benefit at an early age against harm at older ages. In some species, there is evidence that genes have evolved to detect and respond to changes in the environment, e.g. food supply. Evolutionary understanding can also help to understand important features of the human life history such as menopause.},

  Abstract                 = {Translational termination has been a largely ignored aspect of protein synthesis for many years. However, the recent identification of new release-factor genes, the mapping of release-factor functional sites and in vitro reconstitution experiments have provided a deeper understanding of the termination mechanism. In addition, protein-protein interactions among release factors and with other proteins have been revealed. The three-dimensional structures of a prokaryotic ribosome recycling factor and eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) mimic the shape of transfer {RNA}, indicating that they bind to the same ribosomal site. Post-termination events in bacteria have been clarified, linking termination, ribosomal recycling and translation initiation.},

  Abstract                 = {A large-enrollment, undergraduate cellular biology lecture course is described whose primary goal is to help students acquire skill in the interpretation of experimental data. The premise is that this kind of analytical reasoning is not intuitive for most people and, in the absence of hands-on laboratory experience, will not readily develop unless instructional methods and examinations specifically designed to foster it are employed. Promoting scientific thinking forces changes in the roles of both teacher and student. We describe didactic strategies that include directed practice of data analysis in a workshop format, active learning through verbal and written communication, visualization of abstractions diagrammatically, and the use of ancillary small-group mentoring sessions with faculty. The implications for a teacher in reducing the breadth and depth of coverage, becoming coach instead of lecturer, and helping students to diagnose cognitive weaknesses are discussed. In order to determine the efficacy of these strategies, we have carefully monitored student performance and have demonstrated a large gain in a pre- and posttest comparison of scores on identical problems, improved test scores on several successive midterm examinations when the statistical analysis accounts for the relative difficulty of the problems, and higher scores in comparison to students in a control course whose objective was information transfer, not acquisition of reasoning skills. A novel analytical index (student mobility profile) is described that demonstrates that this improvement was not random, but a systematic outcome of the teaching/learning strategies employed. An assessment of attitudes showed that, in spite of finding it difficult, students endorse this approach to learning, but also favor curricular changes that would introduce an analytical emphasis earlier in their training.},

We show that uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells of many patients contain cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that lyse target cells--at plausible peripheral blood mononuclear cell-to-target ratios--with half-lives of less than 1 day. In 23 patients with CD4 counts ranging from 10 to 900 per mu, the average rate of CTL-mediated lysis corresponds to a target cell half-life of 0.7 day. We develop mathematical models to calculate the turnover rate of infected cells subjected to immune-mediated lysis and viral cytopathicity and to estimate the fraction of cells that are killed by CTL as opposed to virus. The models provide new interpretations of drug treatment dynamics and explain why the observed rate of virus decline is roughly constant for different patients. We conclude that in HIV type 1 infection, CTL-mediated lysis can reduce virus load by limiting virus production, with small effects on the half-life of infected cells.},

Maximums in transcript levels occur at three nearly equally spaced intervals in this approximate to40-min cycle of respiration and reduction. Two temporal clusters (4,679 of 5,329) are maximally expressed during the reductive phase of the cycle, whereas a third cluster (650) is maximally expressed during the respiratory phase. Transcription is organized functionally into redox-state superclusters with genes known to be important in respiration or reduction being synthesized in opposite phases of the cycle. The transcriptional cycle gates synchronous bursts in DNA replication in a constant fraction of the population at 40-min intervals. Restriction of DNA synthesis to the reductive phase of the cycle may be an evolutionarily important mechanism for reducing oxidative damage to DNA during replication. },

Earlier analyses have suggested that then is variation in composition in D. melanogaster on both a large scale and a much smaller, within-gene, scale. Here we present analyses on 117 genes which have reliable intron/exon boundaries and no known alternative splicing. We detect significant heterogeneity in G+C content among intron segments from the same gene, as well as a significant positive correlation between the intron and the third codon position G+C content within genes. Both of these observations appear to be due, in part, to an overall decline in intron and third codon position G+C content along Drosophila genes with introns. However, there is also evidence of an increase in third codon position G+C content at the start of genes; this is particularly evident in genes without introns. This is consistent with selection acting against preferred codons at the start of genes. },

The synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency: not only are some codons favored over others, but also their usage can vary significantly from species to species and between different genes in the same organism. Known causes of codon bias include differences in mutation rates as well as selection pressure related to the expression level of a gene, but the standard analysis methods can account for only a fraction of the observed codon usage variation. We here introduce an explicit model of codon usage bias, inspired by statistical physics. Combining this model with a maximum likelihood approach, we are able to clearly identify different sources of bias in various genomes. We have applied the algorithm to Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as 325 prokaryote genomes, and in most cases our model explains essentially all observed variance. },

An instrume nt to measure student comprehension of the Newtonian concept of force, the FCI demonstrates that active learning leads to far superior student conceptual learning than didactic lectures. Co mpared to a working knowledge of physics, biological literacy and illiteracy have an even more direct, dramatic, and personal impact. They shape public research and reproductive health poli cies, the acceptance or rejection of technological advances, such as vaccinations, genetically modified foods and gene therapies, and, on the personal front, the reasoned evaluation of prod uct claims and lifestyle choices. While many students take biology courses at both the secondary and the college levels, there is little in the way of reliable and valid assessment of the e ffectiveness of biological education. This lack has important consequences in terms of general bioliteracy and, in turn, for our society. Here we describe the beginning of a community effor t to define what a bioliterate person needs to know and to develop, validate, and disseminate a tiered series of instruments collectively known as the Biology Concept Inventory (BCI), which accurately measures student comprehension of concepts in introductory, genetic, molecular, cell, and developmental biology.

We used performance on pretests and posttests, and on homework problems to estimate and compare student learning gains between the two semesters. Our results indicated significantly higher learning gains and better conceptual understanding in the more interactive course. To assess reproducibility of these effects, we repeated the interactive course in spring 2005 with similar results. Our findings parallel results of similar teaching-style comparisons made in other disciplines.

We analyzed a sample of 4113 yeast genes in a search for features that might serve to compensate for the inefficient recognition of "weak" TSSs by initiating ribosomes. The first feature found to correlate with variations in TSS strength is differences in the stability of secondary structure upstream and downstream of the start AUG codon. The second feature concerns the characteristics of AUG triplets found at the beginning of the coding sequence, i.e., downstream of the predicted TSS. In particular, the proximal downstream AUG lies in frame with the CDS significantly more often if the TSS itself is located in a "weak" context. The accuracy of TSS annotation, the possibility of polypeptide heterogeneity due to the use of alternative downstream AUGs, and the influence of related features of {mRNA} sequences are discussed.}

Site-directed silent mutagenesis reduced the pauses in translation of CAT in E. coli S30 extract cell-free system and led to the acceleration of the overall rate of CAT protein synthesis. At the same time, the silently mutated protein (with unaltered protein sequence) synthesized in the E. coli S30 extract system was shown to possess 20\% lower specific activity, The data suggest that kinetics of protein translation can affect the in vivo protein-folding pathway, leading to increased levels of protein misfolding.

  Abstract                 = {A modified nucleotide on the 3'-side of the anticodon loop of tRNA is one of the most important structure element regulating codon-anticodone interaction on the ribosome owing to the stacking interaction with the stack of codon-anticodon bases. The presence and identity (pyrimidine, purine or modified purine) of this nucleotide has an essential influence on the energy of the stacking interaction on Aand P-sites of the ribosome. There is a significant influence of the 37-modification by itself on the P-site, whereas there is no such one on the A-site of the ribosome. Comparison of binding enthalpies of tRNA interactions on the P- or A-site of the ribosome with the binding enthalpies of the complex of two tRNAs with the complementary anticodones suggests that the ribosome by itself significantly endows in the thermodynamics of codon-anticodon complex formation. It happens by additional ribosomal interactions with the molecule of tRNA or indirectly by the stabilization of codon-anticodon conformation. In addition to the stacking, tRNA binding in the A and P sites is futher stabilized by the interactions involving some magnesium ions. The number of them involved in those interactions strongly depends on the nucleotide identity in the 37-position of tRNA anticodon loop. },

This led to the identification of extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) as a novel COMP-associated partner. COMP directly binds to ECM1 both in vitro and in vivo. The EGF domain of COMP and the C-terminus of ECM1 mediate the interaction between them. COMP and ECM1 colocalize in the growth plates in vivo. ECM1 inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy, matrix mineralization, and endochondral bone formation, and COMP overcomes the inhibition by ECM1. In addition, COMP-mediated neutralization of ECM1 inhibition depends on their interaction, since COMP largely fails to overcome the ECM1 inhibition in the presence of the EGF domain of COMP, which disturbs the association of COMP and ECM1. These findings provide the first evidence linking the association of COMP and ECM1 and the biological significance underlying the interaction between them in regulating endochondral bone growth.

  Abstract                 = {Gene expression is regulated by a highly coordinated network of events whose efficiency may constrain the level of expression. Among other factors, natural selection for increased translational efficiency and/or fidelity may shape nucleotide composition and. hence, codon usage during evolution. Previous studies have shown that highly expressed genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster have relatively higher codon usage biases. However. in the case of mammals, results have been equivocal. In this study, we assessed the correlation between nucleotide composition and {mRNA} expression levels of rodent genes measured by cDNA microarray and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) techniques. We found that {mRNA} expression levels were correlated with the third nucleotide position GC (GC3) content for both Rattus norvegicus (r = 0.246, p = 0.01; N = 110) and Mus musculus (r = 0.21, p = 0.0026; N = 203) genes. However, no significant correlation was evident between {mRNA} expression level and GC contents of 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) for either species. This suggests that, in rodents, nucleotide composition of coding sequences and UTRs might evolve differentially when considered along an expression gradient. Accordingly, it is possible that higher GC levels may present the rodent genes with a selective advantage for translational efficiency. However, the increase in GC3 content seems to level off above an expressional threshold (e.g., greater than or equal to threefold the median expression for R. norvegicus), suggesting that conflicting demands posed by different aspects of transcriptional and translational machineries (e.g., efficiency versus fidelity) may set an upper limit for GC3.},

In most cases we found the Delta G of transfer from octanol to water to be the best model for evolutionary constraints, in contrast to the much weaker correlation with the Delta G of transfer from cyclohexane to water, a property found to be highly correlated to changes in stability in site-directed mutagenesis studies, This suggests that natural evolution may follow different rules than those suggested by results obtained in the laboratory. A high degree of conservation of a surface residue's relative hydrophobicity was also observed, a fact that cannot be explained by constraints on protein stability but that may reflect the consequences of the reverse-hydrophobic effect. Local propensity, especially or-helical propensity, is rather poorly conserved during evolution, indicating that non-local interactions dominate protein structure formation. We found that changes in volume were important in specific cases, most significantly in transitions among the hydrophobic residues in buried locations. To demonstrate how these techniques could be used to understand particular protein families, we derived and analyzed mutation matrices for the hypervariable and framework regions of antibody light chain V regions. We found a surprisingly high conservation of hydrophobicity in the hypervariable region, possibly indicating an important role for hydrophobicity in antigen recognition. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Codon-level models have been mechanistic with a small number of parameters designed to take into account features, such as transition-transversion bias, codon frequency bias, and synonymous-nonsynonymous amino acid substitution bias. Amino acid models have been empirical, attempting to summarize the replacement patterns observed in large quantities of data and not explicitly considering the distinct factors that shape protein evolution. We have estimated the first empirical codon model (ECM). Previous codon models assume that protein evolution proceeds only by successive single nucleotide substitutions, but our results indicate that model accuracy is significantly improved by incorporating instantaneous doublet and triplet changes. We also find that the affiliations between codons, the amino acid each encodes and the physicochemical properties of the amino acids are main factors driving the process of codon evolution. Neither multiple nucleotide changes nor the strong influence of the genetic code nor amino acids' physicochemical properties form a part of standard mechanistic models and their views of how codon evolution proceeds. We have implemented the ECM for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis, and an assessment of its ability to describe protein evolution shows that it consistently outperforms comparable mechanistic codon models. We point out the biological interpretation of our ECM and possible consequences for studies of selection.},

  Abstract                 = {The mode of replication and organisation of bacterial genomes impose asymmetry on their nucleotide composition. The asymmetry is seen in coding and non-coding sequences and is reflected in the amino acid composition of proteins. The mechanisms generating asymmetry include: unequal mutation rates connected with replication and transcription, selection forces positioning genes and signal sequences nonrandomly in the genome, and protein coding constraints on coding sequences. There are different methods of visualising and measuring the asymmetry. Some of them can assess the contribution of individual mechanisms to the observed asymmetry and those have been described in greater detail. Asymmetric mutational and selection pressures differentiate the rates of evolution of genes on leading and lagging strands. The genes relocated to the opposite strand have to adapt to a different mutational pressure or are eliminated. Translocations from leading to lagging strands are more often selected against than from lagging to leading strands. Comparison of intergenic sequences that have lost the coding function to the original genes enables finding the frequencies of the twelve substitution rates in sequences free from selection. In the absence of selection, the half-time of substitution of a given type of nucleotide is linearly correlated with the fraction of that nucleotide in the sequence. },

  Abstract                 = {Selection of the translational initiation site in most eukaryotic {mRNA}s appears to occur via a scanning mechanism which predicts that proximity to the 5' end plays a dominant role in identifying the start codon. This 'position effect' is seen in cases where a mutation creates an AUG codon upstream from the normal start site and translation shifts to the upstream site. The position effect is evident also in cases where a silent internal AUG codon is activated upon being relocated closer to the 5' end. Two mechanisms for escaping the first-AUG rule - reinitiation and context-dependent leaky scanning - enable downstream AUG codons to be accessed in some {mRNA}s. Although these mechanisms are not new, many new examples of their use have emerged. Via these escape pathways, the scanning mechanism operates even in extreme cases, such as a plant virus {mRNA} in which translation initiates from three start sites over a distance of 900 nt. This depends on careful structural arrangements, however, which are rarely present in cellular {mRNA}s. Understanding the rules for initiation of translation enables understanding of human diseases in which the expression of a critical gene is reduced by mutations that add upstream AUG codons or change the context around the AUG START codon. The opposite problem occurs in the case of hereditary thrombocythemia: translational efficiency is increased by mutations that remove or restructure a small upstream open reading frame in thrombopoietin {mRNA}, and the resulting overproduction of the cytokine causes the disease. This and other examples support the idea that 5' leader sequences are sometimes structured deliberately in a way that constrains scanning in order to prevent harmful overproduction of potent regulatory proteins. The accumulated evidence reveals how the scanning mechanism dictates the pattern of transcription - forcing production of monocistronic {mRNA}s - and the pattern of translation of eukaryotic cellular and viral genes.

Models of optimal allocation of limiting resources are useful tools for predicting age and size at maturity - key components of fitness - for all lifestyles. Early models considered annual plants. Recently, they have been generalized to other short-lived organisms and also to perennials in which growth and reproduction schedules following maturation can be predicted. A review of existing models shows that differences in trophic conditions and mortality are the main sources of interand intraspecific variation in size. }

Here the analysis is extended to animals with indeterminate growth, such as fish or reptiles. In a seasonal environment it is optimal to grow after maturation, and increasingly more resources should be devoted to reproduction year after year. This leads to growth curves that closely resemble Bertalanffy's curves characterized by growth constant k and asymptotic length l(infinity). Sets of parameters describing mortality and productivity were generated with a random number generator. Then the schedule of growth was calculated for each 'species' obtained, under the assumption of optimal allocation of resources. Interspecific comparisons in a set of such species resemble the empirical patterns discovered by Beverton \& Holt and discussed extensively by Charnov: mortality rate and growth constant k are positively related, length at maturity and asymptotic length l(infinity) are positively correlated, and k and l(infinity) are negatively correlated. Data for fish and reptiles match these predictions.}

  Abstract                 = {Optimal allocation of energy to growth and reproduction was studied with a dynamic optimization method for long-lived animals inhabiting a seasonal environment. We found that, after maturation, it is optimal to grow either over several years (if the animals age in the sense that their mortality increases with age) or asymptotically (if there is no ageing). Asymptotic growth can be well approximated with Bertalanffy's equation, even if the animals are able to grow to infinity. This is because it is optimal to allocate an increasing proportion of surplus energy to reproduction year after year following maturation. Age at first reproduction depends on mortality in both favourable and unfavourable seasons, and also depends on the favourable season length - it is optimal to mature early when mortality is high in either season or the season is short. Size at maturity depends additionally on the parameters of the equation describing the size-dependence of the production rate. When mortality in the unfavourable season is high compared to mortality in the favourable season, a large part of growth is realized after maturation. The model qualitatively explains growth patterns and life histories in fish, reptiles, amphibians and some long-lived invertebrates which grow after maturation. To understand better the diversity of life histories, held biologists working on such animals should focus on differences in the ageing rate, favourable season length, mortality rates in both seasons and the size-dependence of production rate. Optimization models based on the allocation principle are promising tools to integrate these kinds of data.}

The experiments reporting these rates have measured several distinct errors using several methods and reporter systems. Variation in reported rates may reflect real differences in rates among the errors tested or in sensitivity of the reporter systems. To develop a more accurate understanding of the range of error rates, we developed a system to quantify the frequency of every possible misreading error at a defined codon in Escherichia coli. This system uses an essential lysine in the active site of firefly luciferase. Mutations in Lys529 result in up to a 1600-fold reduction in activity, but the phenotype varies with amino acid. We hypothesized that residual activity of some of the mutant genes might result from misreading of the mutant codons by {tRNA}(UUU)(Lys), the cognate {tRNA} for the lysine codons, AAA and AAG. Our data validate this hypothesis and reveal details about relative missense error rates of near-cognate codons. The error rates in E. coli do, in fact, vary widely. One source of variation is the effect of competition by cognate {tRNA}s for the mutant codons; higher error frequencies result from lower competition from low-abundance {tRNA}s. We also used the system to study the effect of ribosomal protein mutations known to affect error rates and the effect of error-inducing antibiotics, finding that they affect misreading on only a subset of near-cognate codons and that their effect may be less general than previously thought.},

  Abstract                 = {The process of protein synthesis must be sufficiently rapid and sufficiently accurate to support continued cellular growth. Failure in speed or accuracy can have dire consequences, including disease in humans. Most estimates of the accuracy come from studies of bacterial systems, principally Escherichia coli, and have involved incomplete analysis of possible errors. We recently used a highly quantitative system to measure the frequency of all types of misreading errors by a single tRNA in E. coli. That study found a wide variation in error frequencies among codons; a major factor causing that variation is competition between the correct (cognate) and incorrect (near-cognate) aminoacyl-tRNAs for the mutant codon. Here we extend that analysis to measure the frequency of missense errors by two tRNAs in a eukaryote, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data show that in yeast errors vary by codon from a low of 4 x 10(-5) to a high of 6.9 x 10(-4) per codon and that error frequency is in general about threefold lower than in E. coli, which may suggest that yeast has additional mechanisms that reduce missense errors. Error rate again is strongly influenced by tRNA competition. Surprisingly, missense errors involving wobble position mispairing were much less frequent in S. cerevisiae than in E. coli. Furthermore, the error-inducing aminoglycoside antibiotic, paromomycin, which stimulates errors on all error-prone codons in E. coli, has a more codon-specific effect in yeast.},

  Abstract                 = {In \emph{Escherichia coli}, uridine in the wobble position of {tRNA}(Glu) and {tRNA}(Lys) is modified to mnm(5)s(2)U34. This modification is believed to restrict the base-pairing capability, i.e. to prevent misreading of near-cognate codons and reduce the efficiency of cognate codon reading, especially of codons ending in G. We have determined the influence of the 5-methylaminomethyl and the 2-thio modifications of mnm(5)s(2)U34 in {tRNA}(Glu) on the translation rate of the glutamate codons GAA and GAG \emph{in vivo}. In wild-type cells, GAG is translated slower (7.7 codons/second) and GAA faster (18 codons/second) than the average codon (13 codons/second). Surprisingly, {tRNA}(Glu) lacking the 5-methylaminomethyl group, thus containing s(2)U34, translated GAA twofold faster (47 codons/second) and GAG four-fold slower (1.9 codons/second) than fully modified {tRNA}(Glu). In contrast, {tRNA}(Glu) that contains mnm(5)U34 instead of mnm(5)s(2)U34 translated GAA fourfold slower (4.5 codons/second) and GAG only 20\% slower (6.2 codons/second). Clearly, the 5-methylaminomethyl group of mnm(5)s(2)U34 facilitates base-pairing with G while decreasing base-pairing with A, resulting in rates of translation of GAG and GAA that approach that of the average codon. The 2-thio group increases the recognition of GAA and has only a minor effect on the decoding of GAG. Furthermore, the 2-thio group is important for aminoacylation (see the accompanying paper). These data imply that the function of mnm(5)s(2)U34 may be different from what has been suggested previously. (C) 1998 Academic Press. },

  Abstract                 = {Lineage-specific gene loss, to a large extent, accounts for the differences in gene repertoires between genomes, particularly among eukaryotes. We derived a parsimonious scenario of gene losses for eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) from seven complete eukaryotic genomes. The scenario involves substantial gene loss in fungi, nematodes, and insects. Based on this evolutionary scenario and estimates of the divergence times between major eukaryotic phyla, we introduce a numerical measure, the propensity for gene loss (PGL). We explore the connection among the propensity of a gene to be lost in evolution (PGL value), protein sequence divergence, the effect of gene knockout on fitness, the number of protein-protein interactions, and expression level for the genes in KOGs. Significant correlations between PGL and each of these variables were detected. Genes that have a lower propensity to be lost in eukaryotic evolution accumulate fewer substitutions in their protein sequences and tend to be essential for the organism viability, tend to be highly expressed, and have many interaction partners. The dependence between PGL and gene dispensability and interactivity is much stronger than that for sequence evolution rate. Thus, propensity of a gene to be lost during evolution seems to be a direct reflection of its biological importance.},

  Abstract                 = {The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

  Abstract                 = {The database of protein complexes (PROTCOM) is a compilation of known 3D structures of protein-protein complexes enriched with artificially created domain-domain structures using the available entries in the Protein Data Bank. The domain-domain structures are generated by parsing single chain structures into loosely connected domains and are important features of the database. The database (http://www.ces.clemson.edu/compbio/protcom) could be used for benchmarking purposes of the docking and other algorithms for predicting 3D structures of protein-protein complexes. The database can be utilized as a template database in the homology or threading methods for modeling the 3D structures of unknown protein-protein complexes. PROTCOM provides the scientific community with an integrated set of tools for browsing, searching, visualizing and downloading a pool of protein complexes. The user is given the option to select a subset of entries using a combination of up to 10 different criteria. As on July 2006 the database contains 1770 entries, each of which consists of the known 3D structures and additional relevant information that can be displayed either in text-only or in visual mode. },

  Abstract                 = {Prominent evolutionary theories of morality maintain that the adaptations that underlie moral judgment and behavior function, at least in part, to deliver benefits (or prevent harm) to others. These explanations are based on the theories of kin selection and reciprocal altruism, and they predict that moral systems are designed to maximize Hamiltonian inclusive fitness. In sharp contrast, however, moral judgment often appears Kantian and rule-based. To reconcile this apparent discrepancy, some theorists have claimed that Kantian moral rules result from mechanisms that implement simple heuristics for maximizing welfare. To test this idea, we conducted a set of studies in which subjects (N=1290) decided whether they would kill one person to save five others, varying the relationship of the subject with the others involved (strangers, friends, brothers). Are participants more likely to observe the Kantian rule against killing in decisions about brothers and friends, rather than strangers? We found the reverse. Subjects reported greater willingness to kill a brother or friend than a stranger (in order to save five others of the same type). These results suggest that the rule-based structure of moral cognition is not explained by kin selection, reciprocity, or other altruism theories. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Drawing from two subject populations-one undergraduate and one Internet-based-we look at the relationships among (i) abstract political commitments; (ii) attitudes about sexuality; and (iii) views surrounding recreational drugs. Whereas some theories suggest that drug views are best understood as the result of abstract political ideology, we suggest that these views can be better understood in the context of reproductive strategy. We show that, as predicted by a strategic construal, drug attitudes are best predicted by sexual items rather than abstract political commitments and, further, that the relationship between factors such as political ideology and drugs, while positive, are reduced to zero or nearly zero when items assessing sexuality are controlled for. We conclude that considering morality from the standpoint of strategic interests is a potentially useful way to understand why humans care about third party behaviour.},

Faecal pats (1.5 kg each) of naturally infected horses were placed on pasture, and samples of faeces and surrounding vegetation (10 g each) were collected each month, excluding the winter months, from November 2002 until April 2004. The number of infective third stage larvae was calculated in each sample and compared with that from the control faecal samples cultivated in the laboratory. In the control samples, the ratio of infective third stage larvae to the initial number of eggs was from 54.7\% in June up to 84.2\% in November. This ratio depended on the presence of nematophagous fungi growing in the faeces. On pasture, the development of larvae to the infective third stage took approximately 4 weeks in the warm season, from April until September. In October, a percentage of the eggs (25\% to EPG value) did not hatch. No larval development was observed in faeces in November. A minute quantity of larvae, about 0.03\% of their initial number, was observed to survive on pasture for the 12 months. Migration of infective larvae from the faeces to vegetation was not intensive, between 71\% and 89\% of larvae remained in the faeces 4 weeks after deposition of the faecal pats, the percentage related to soil humidity in each month. The proportion of larvae successfully surviving during winter appeared to be maximal in faecal. pats deposited on pasture in September of the previous year (up to 42.0\% of the initial number of larvae). Some larvae were observed surviving winter in soil beneath the faecal pats. The results of the study demonstrated that horse pastures in the central part of Ukraine are never free from the infective third stage larvae of strongyles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of a range of therapeutic drugs, previously demonstrated to be effective in preventing the development of T. gondii-associated behavioural and cognitive alterations in rats, on definitive-host predator specificity was also tested. Using a Y-shaped maze design, we demonstrated that T. gondii-associated behavioural changes, apparently aimed to increase predation rate, do appear to be specific to that of the feline definitive host - there were significant and consistent differences between the (untreated) infected and uninfected rats groups where T. gondii-infected rats tended to choose the definitive host feline-predator-associated maze arm and nest-box significantly more often than a maze arm or nest-box treated with non-definitive host predator (mink) odour. Drug treatment of infected rats prevented any such host-specificity from being displayed. We discuss Our results in terms of their potential implications both for T. gondii epidemiology and the evolution of parasite-altered behaviour. },

Here we examine yeasts' tRNA isopentenyltransferases (i.e., dimethylallyltransferase, DMATase, members of the Delta(2)-isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase, IPPT superfamily) encoded by tit1(+) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and MOD5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose homologs are Escherichia coli miaA, the human tumor suppressor TRIT1, and the Caenorhabditis elegans life-span gene product GRO-1. A major determinant of miaA activity is known to be the single-stranded tRNA sequence, A36A37A38, in a stem-loop. tRNA(CCA)(Trp) from either yeast is a Tit1p substrate, but neither is a Mod5p substrate despite the presence of A36A37A38. We show that Tit1p accommodates a broader range of substrates than Mod5p. tRNA(CCA)(Trp) is distinct from Mod5p substrates, which we sort into two classes based on the presence of G at position 34 and other elements. A single substitution of C34 to G converts tRNA(CCA)(Trp) to a Mod5p substrate in vitro and in vivo, consistent with amino acid contacts to G34 in existing Mod5p-tRNA(GCA)(Cys) crystal structures. Mutation of Mod5p in its G34 recognition loop region debilitates it differentially for its G34 (class I) substrates. Multiple alignments reveal that the G34 recognition loop sequence of Mod5p differs significantly from Tit1p, which more resembles human TRIT1 and other DMATases. We show that TRIT1 can also modify tRNA(CCA)(Trp) consistent with broad recognition similar to Tit1p. This study illustrates previously unappreciated molecular plasticity and biological diversity of the tRNA-isopentenyltransferase system of eukaryotes.},

  Abstract                 = {The priming of a T cell results from its physical interaction with a dendritic cell (DC) that presents the cognate antigenic peptide. The success rate of such interactions is extremely low, because the precursor frequency of a naive T cell recognizing a specific antigen is in the range of 1:10(5)-10(6). To make this principle practicable, encounter frequencies between DCs and T cells are maximized within lymph nodes (LNs) that are compact immunological projections of the peripheral tissue they drain. But LNs are more than passive meeting places for DCs that immigrated from the tissue and lymphocytes that recirculated via the blood. The microanatomy of the LN stroma actively organizes the cellular encounters by providing preformed migration tracks that create dynamic but highly ordered movement patterns. LN architecture further acts as a sophisticated filtration system that sieves the incoming interstitial fluid at different levels and guarantees that immunologically relevant antigens are loaded on DCs or B cells while inert substances are channeled back into the blood circulation. This review focuses on the non-hematopoietic infrastructure of the lymph node. We describe the association between fibroblastic reticular cell, conduit, DC, and T cell as the essential functional unit of the T-cell cortex. },

However, modes of evolution cannot be inferred solely from the distribution of natural variation, because selection interacts with demography and mutation rates to shape polymorphism and divergence. We estimated the effects of naturally occurring mutations on gene expression while minimizing the effect of natural selection. We demonstrate that sensitivity of gene expression to mutations increases with both increasing trans-mutational target size and the presence of a TATA box. Genes with greater sensitivity to mutations are also more sensitive to systematic environmental perturbations and stochastic noise. These results provide a mechanistic basis for gene expression evolvability that can serve as a foundation for realistic models of regulatory evolution.},

The prevalence and egg (larval) count maxima of the nematodes were observed. The first seasonal peak occurrence of strongylid infection appeared at the start of spring (February, March) and the second in the autumn (September). The strongyle eggs were found in all groups. No differences were noted between strongylid egg counts in horses with and without an access to the pastures. The highest prevalence was observed in saddle horses for children. Strongylus spp, occurred more frequently in horses without an access to the pastures. The egg counts indicated that Parascaris equorum contributed appreciably to eggs in the faeces of horses to two years of age, the highest prevalence of Strongyloides westeri occurred in faeces of yearlings and stud horses. Infection of Habronema spp. showed gradual accumulation of these nematodes only in horses with an access to the pastures.}

  Abstract                 = {Migration to herbage of Cyathostominae from experimentally deposited fresh or incubated faecal samples containing a known number of cyathostome L3 was studied in the Czech Republic for up to 1 year. It was found out that most larvae remained quite close to the faecal samples. Of all larvae recovered from herbage 89.18\%, were collected within 10 cm of the faeces. Temporal variation in the presence of Cyathostominae larvae on vegetation may account for poor recovery of Cyathostominae L3 in the field. A few infective larvae (0.05-2.74\% of the larvae placed on the plot) were found as far as 30 cm from the faeces after 1 or 2 weeks. The number of larvae was significantly higher in June, with maximum recoveries of 4.97\% (P < 0.05). Time of day was also significantly related to the number of L3 recovered, larval recovery was greater in the morning than at noontime, the highest number of L3 was observed at 8 am. Moisture and temperature were the most important weather factors associated with lateral larval migrations. There was a closer relation between the larval yields and monthly rainfall (r = 0.47) than between the larval recoveries and weekly rainfall (r = 0.23, r = 0.24). A significant amount of migration occurred during dew. An insignificant amount of migration occurred during dry weather. },

The recently sequenced 12 Drosophila genomes provide a unique opportunity to shed light on these unresolved issues. Here, we focus on the role of natural selection in shaping evolutionary rates. We use the Drosophila genomic data to distinguish between factors that increase the strength of purifying selection on proteins and factors that affect the amount of positive selection experienced by proteins. We confirm the importance of translational selection in shaping protein evolution in Drosophila and show that factors such as tissue bias in expression, gene essentiality, intron number, and recombination rate also contribute to evolutionary rate variation among proteins. },

  Abstract                 = {Most current models of sequence evolution assume that all sites of a protein evolve under the same substitution process, characterized by a 20 X 20 substitution matrix. Here, we propose to relax this assumption by developing a Bayesian mixture model that allows the amino-acid replacement pattern at different sites of a protein alignment to be described by distinct substitution processes. Our model, named CAT, assumes the existence of distinct processes (or classes) differing by their equilibrium frequencies over the 20 residues. Through the use of a Dirichlet process prior, the total number of classes and their respective amino-acid profiles, as well as the affiliations of each site to a given class, are all free variables of the model. In this way, the CAT model is able to adapt to the complexity actually present in the data, and it yields an estimate of the substitutional heterogeneity through the posterior mean number of classes. We show that a significant level of heterogeneity is present in the substitution patterns of proteins, and that the standard one-matrix model fails to account for this heterogeneity. By evaluating the Bayes factor, we demonstrate that the standard model is outperformed by CAT on all of the data sets which we analyzed. Altogether, these results suggest that the complexity of the pattern of substitution of real sequences is better captured by the CAT model, offering the possibility of studying its impact on phylogenetic reconstruction and its connections with structure-function determinants.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models of commercially important species enable one to integrate the diversity of information on these species, understand mechanisms responsible for observed population dynamics, and assess management scenarios. We present a population model for blue mussels Mytilus edulis grown in suspended culture in 2 bays in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The model incorporates a number of ecological processes, namely allometric growth of individual mussels, temperature-dependent growth rates (based on the Lassiter-Kearns equation), and survival of mussels based on self-thinning. Analysis of our model suggests that the optimal temperature for mussel growth is 15.8 degrees C. Also, survival does not depend on site or year, indicating that self-thinning is probably due to competition for space rather than food or other site-specific conditions. Based on sensitivity analyses, growth predictions are robust to changes in parameter values, while survival predictions are quite sensitive to changes in the strength of the effect of initial mussel density and of self-thinning. Evaluation of management scenarios over one grow-out period indicates that date of deployment strongly affects time for seeds to reach commercial size. Optimal initial mussel density depends on whether one wants to maximise the proportion of mussels surviving to harvest or the number of mussels available at harvest; this decision depends on whether seed availability or lease area is limiting.},

  Abstract                 = {Synonymous sites are generally assumed to be subject to weak selective constraint. For this reason, they are often neglected as a possible source of important functional variation. We use site frequency spectra from deep population sequencing data to show that, contrary to this expectation, 22\% of four-fold synonymous (4D) sites in Drosophila melanogaster evolve under very strong selective constraint while few, if any, appear to be under weak constraint. Linking polymorphism with divergence data, we further find that the fraction of synonymous sites exposed to strong purifying selection is higher for those positions that show slower evolution on the Drosophila phylogeny. The function underlying the inferred strong constraint appears to be separate from splicing enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and the translational optimization generating canonical codon bias. The fraction of synonymous sites under strong constraint within a gene correlates well with gene expression, particularly in the mid-late embryo, pupae, and adult developmental stages. Genes enriched in strongly constrained synonymous sites tend to be particularly functionally important and are often involved in key developmental pathways. Given that the observed widespread constraint acting on synonymous sites is likely not to Drosophila, the role of synonymous sites in genetic disease and adaptation should be reevaluated.},

  Abstract                 = {Literature on schizophrenia and other mental illnesses has emphasized the compatibility of evidence with genetic causation without adequately considering alternative hypotheses of disease causation. Although some studies from the mid-20th century reported associations between certain pathogens and schizophrenia, only recently has the possibility of infectious causation of schizophrenia again become an active focus of research. Infectious causation of schizophrenia is still, however, generally regarded as less well demonstrated than genetic causation. This article evaluates the evidence that has been used to support genetic and infectious causation. Our consideration of infectious causation focuses on the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii but also assesses other pathogens that may contribute to the development of some of the illnesses currently categorized as schizophrenia. Although evidence generally accepted as demonstrating genetic causation can be readily explained by hypotheses of infectious causation, some of the evidence implicating infectious causation cannot be similarly explained by genetic causation. This asymmetry indicates that a scientific approach to the causation of schizophrenia needs to put a greater emphasis on tests that distinguish hypotheses of genetic causation from those of infectious causation. }

Within this framework, we reconstructed an extensive, high-quality functional gene network for \emph{{S}accharomyces cerevisiae}, consisting of 4681 (similar to81\%) of the known yeast genes linked by similar to34,000 probabilistic linkages comparable in accuracy to small-scale interaction assays. The integrated linkages distinguish true from false-positive interactions in earlier data sets; new interactions emerge from genes' network contexts, as shown for genes in chromatin modification and ribosome biogenesis. },

  Abstract                 = {The prevailing mechanism for recurrent and some nonrecurrent rearrangements causing genomic disorders is nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between region-specific low-copy repeats (LCRs). For other nonrecurrent rearrangements, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is implicated. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked dysmyelinating disorder caused most frequently (60\%-70\%) by nonrecurrent duplication of the dosage-sensitive proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene but also by nonrecurrent deletion or point mutations. Many PLP1 duplication junctions are refractory to breakpoint sequence analysis, an observation inconsistent with a simple recombination mechanism. Our current analysis of junction sequences in PMD patients confirms the occurrence of simple tandem PLP1 duplications but also uncovers evidence for sequence complexity at some junctions. These data are consistent with a replication-based mechanism that we term FoSTeS, for replication Fork Stalling and Template Switching. We propose that complex duplication and deletion rearrangements associated with PMD, and potentially other nonrecurrent rearrangements, may be explained by this replication-based mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {Misfolded proteins are associated with several pathological conditions including neurodegeneration. Although some of these abnormally folded proteins result from mutations in genes encoding disease-associated proteins (for example, repeat-expansion diseases), more general mechanisms that lead to misfolded proteins in neurons remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that low levels of mischarged transfer RNAs (tRNAs) can lead to an intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins in neurons. These accumulations are accompanied by upregulation of cytoplasmic protein chaperones and by induction of the unfolded protein response. We report that the mouse sticky mutation, which causes cerebellar Purkinje cell loss and ataxia, is a missense mutation in the editing domain of the alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene that compromises the proofreading activity of this enzyme during aminoacylation of tRNAs. These findings demonstrate that disruption of translational fidelity in terminally differentiated neurons leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and cell death, and provide a novel mechanism underlying neurodegeneration. },

CAI is a geometric mean of the relative usage of codons in a gene, and is calculated using the codon usage table trained with a set of highly expressed genes. In contrast, rCAI is computed by subtracting the background codon usage trained with two noncoding frames of highly expressed genes from the codon usage in the coding frame. rCAI has higher signal-to-noise ratio than CAI, considering that noncoding frames would not show codon bias. Translation efficiency and protein abundance correlates comparably or better with rCAI than CAI or other measures such as 'effective number of codons' and 'SCUMBLE offsets'. Within overlapping coding regions, one of the two coding frames dominates in codon usage bias according to rCAI. Presumably, rCAI could substitute CAI in diverse applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequence polymorphisms affect gene expression by perturbing the complex network of regulatory interactions. We propose a probabilistic method, called Geronemo, which directly aims to identify the mechanism by which genetic changes perturb the regulatory network. Geronemo automatically constructs a set of coregulated genes (modules), whose regulation can involve both sequence variations and expression of regulators. By exploiting the modularity of genetic regulatory systems, Geronemo reveals regulatory relationships that are indiscernible when genes are considered in isolation, allowing the recovery of intricate combinatorial regulation. By incorporating both expression and genotype of regulators, Geronemo captures cases where the effect of sequence variation on its targets is indirect. We applied Geronemo to a data set from the progeny generated by a cross between laboratory BY4716 (BY) and wild RM11-1a (RM) isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Geronemo produced previously undescribed hypotheses regarding genetic perturbations in the yeast regulatory network, including transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and chromatin modification. In particular, we find a large number of modules that have both chromosomal characteristics and are regulated by chromatin modification proteins. Indeed, a large fraction of the variance in the expression can be explained by a small number of markers associated with chromatin modifiers. Additional analysis reveals positive selection for sequence evolution of elements in the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex. Overall, our results suggest that a significant part of individual expression variation in yeast arises from evolution of a small number of chromatin structure modifiers. },

As societies with higher pathogen prevalence have been found to exhibit more pronounced antipathogen psychological tendencies and cultural practices (e.g., conformity, collectivism), we hypothesized that pathogen prevalence may predict endorsement of the binding moral foundations, which may also serve to minimize pathogen transmission. We examined associations between historical and contemporary pathogen prevalence and endorsement of the moral foundations via multilevel analyses. Country-level analyses showed that even when controlling for gross domestic product per capita, historical (but not contemporary) pathogen prevalence significantly predicted endorsement of the binding foundations, but not individualizing foundations. Multilevel analyses showed that this pattern held even when controlling for individual-level variation in political orientation, gender, education, and age. These results highlight the utility of a functional evolutionary approach to understanding patterns of morals across societies and individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A specialized histone and other chromatin-bound factors nucleate a dynamic protein assembly that is required for the proper segregation of sister chromatids. In several organisms, including the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the RNAi pathway contributes to the formation of silent chromatin in pericentromeric regions. Little is known about how chromatin-remodeling factors contribute to heterochromatic integrity and centromere function. Here we show that the histone chaperone and remodeling complex FACT is required for centromeric-heterochromatin integrity and accurate chromosome segregation. We show that Spt16 and Pob3 are two subunits of the S. pombe FACT complex. Surprisingly, yeast strains deleted for pob3+ are viable and alleviate gene silencing at centromeric repeats and at the silent mating-type locus. Importantly, like heterochromatin and RNAi pathway mutants, Pob3 null strains exhibit lagging chromosomes on anaphase spindles. Whereas the processing of centromeric RNA transcripts into siRNAs is maintained in Pob3 mutants, Swi6-association with the centromere is reduced. Our studies provide the first experimental evidence for a role of the RNA polymerase II cofactor FACT in heterochromatin integrity and in centromere function.},

As such, NMD provides a means to degrade abnormal {mRNA}s that encode potentially deleterious truncated proteins. Additionally, an estimated one-third of naturally occurring, alternatively spliced {mRNA}s is also targeted for NMD. Given the extraordinary frequency of alternative splicing together with data indicating that naturally occurring transcripts other than alternatively spliced {mRNA}s are likewise targeted for NMD, it is believed that mammalian cells routinely utilize NMD to achieve proper levels of gene expression. },

Although the method uses the Bayesian framework and exploits the computational simplicity of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it provides valid frequentist inferences such as the maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors. The inferences are completely invariant to the choice of the prior distributions and therefore avoid the inherent subjectivity of the Bayesian approach. The data cloning method is easily implemented using standard MCMC software. Data cloning is particularly useful for analysing ecological situations in which hierarchical statistical models, such as state-space models and mixed effects models, are appropriate. We illustrate the method by fitting two nonlinear population dynamics models to data in the presence of process and observation noise. },

  Abstract                 = {Organismic evolution requires that variation at distinct hierarchical levels and attributes be coherently integrated, often in the face of disparate environmental and genetic pressures. A central part of the evolutionary analysis of biological systems remains to decipher the causal connections between organism-wide (or genome-wide) attributes (e.g., {mRNA} abundance, protein length, codon bias, recombination rate, genomic position, mutation rate, etc) as well as their role-together with mutation, selection, and genetic drift-in shaping patterns of evolutionary variation in any of the attributes themselves. Here we combine genome-wide evolutionary analysis of protein and gene expression data to highlight fundamental relationships among genomic attributes and their associations with the evolution of both protein sequences and gene expression levels. Our results show that protein divergence is positively coupled with both gene expression polymorphism and divergence. We show moreover that although the number of protein-protein interactions in Drosophila is negatively associated with protein divergence as well as gene expression polymorphism and divergence, protein-protein interactions cannot account for the observed coupling between regulatory and structural evolution. Furthermore, we show that proteins with higher rates of amino acid substitutions tend to have larger sizes and tend to be expressed at lower {mRNA} abundances, whereas genes with higher levels of gene expression divergence and polymorphism tend to have shorter sizes and tend to be expressed at higher {mRNA} abundances. Finally, we show that protein length is negatively associated with both number of protein-protein interactions and {mRNA} abundance and that interacting proteins in Drosophila show similar amounts of divergence. We suggest that protein sequences and gene expression are subjected to similar evolutionary dynamics, possibly because of similarity in the fitness effect (i.e., strength of stabilizing selection) of disruptions in a gene's protein sequence or its {mRNA} expression. We conclude that, as more and better data accumulate, understanding the causal connections among biological traits and how they are integrated over time to constrain or promote structural and regulatory evolution may finally become possible. },

  Abstract                 = {The choice of synonymous codons used to encode a polypeptide contributes to substantial differences in translation efficiency between genes. However, both the magnitude and the mechanisms of codon-mediated effects are unknown, as neither the effects of individual codons nor the parameters that modulate codon-mediated regulation are understood, particularly in eukaryotes. To explore this problem in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we performed the first systematic analysis of codon effects on expression. We find that the arginine codon CGA is strongly inhibitory, resulting in progressively and sharply reduced expression with increased CGA codon dosage. CGA-mediated inhibition of expression is primarily due to wobble decoding of CGA, since it is nearly completely suppressed by coexpression of an exact match anticodon-mutated tRNA Arg(UCG), and is associated with generation of a smaller RNA fragment, likely due to endonucleolytic cleavage at a stalled ribosome. Moreover, CGA codon pairs are more effective inhibitors of expression than individual CGA codons. These results directly implicate decoding by the ribosome and interactions at neighboring sites within the ribosome as mediators of codon-specific translation efficiency. },

The method is employed to examine (1) how changes in transmission rates during different stages of infection affect the rate of spread of HIV/AIDS both in wholly susceptible populations and in populations where the number of potential hosts is limited, (2) the way the relative frequencies of the different stages of infection vary over time, (3) how the rate at which the epidemic is growing (or diminishing) affects the fraction of HIV-infected individuals who manifest the symptoms of AIDS, (4) the effect of treatment on the rate of spread of HIV, and (5) the potential effects of natural selection on the virulence of HIV. }

  Abstract                 = {A homomer is formed by selfinteracting copies of a protein unit. This is functionally important(1,2), as in allostery(3-5), and structurally crucial because mis- assembly of homomers is implicated in disease(6,7). Homomers are widespread, with 50 - 70\% of proteins with a known quaternary state assembling into such structures(8,9). Despite their prevalence, their role in the evolution of cellular machinery(10,11) and the potential for their use in the design of new molecular machines(12,13), little is known about the mechanisms that drive formation of homomers at the level of evolution and assembly in the cell(9,14). Here we present an analysis of over 5,000 unique atomic structures and show that the quaternary structure of homomers is conserved in over 70\% of protein pairs sharing as little as 30\% sequence identity. Where quaternary structure is not conserved among the members of a protein family, a detailed investigation revealed well- defined evolutionary pathways by which proteins transit between different quaternary structure types. Furthermore, we show by perturbing subunit interfaces within complexes and by mass spectrometry analysis(15), that the ( dis) assembly pathway mimics the evolutionary pathway. These data represent a molecular analogy to Haeckel's evolutionary paradigm of embryonic development, where an intermediate in the assembly of a complex represents a form that appeared in its own evolutionary history. Our model of self- assembly allows reliable prediction of evolution and assembly of a complex solely from its crystal structure. },

We discuss here the evidence for naive T-cell traffic into the non-lymphoid environment, compare and contrast this movement with what is known of memory T cells, and finally discuss the functional importance of why naive T cells might access the parenchymal tissues.},

Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis. },

Meanwhile, we found evidence that genes with high functional/regulatory complexity do not have longer introns and longer proteins. The genome design hypothesis is thus not supported. Furthermore, we found that housekeeping genes are not more compact than the narrowly expressed somatic genes with similar average expression levels. Because housekeeping genes are expected to have much higher germline expression levels than narrowly expressed somatic genes, transcription-associated deletion bias is not supported.

  Abstract                 = {Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a process by which ribosomes produce two different polypeptides from the same mRNA. In this study, we propose three different kinetic models of 1 PRF, incorporating the effects of the ribosomal E-, Pand A-sites toward promoting efficient 1 frameshifting in Escherichia coli. Specifically, the timing of E-site tRNA dissociation is discussed within the context of the kinetic proofreading mechanism of aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) selection. Mathematical modeling using previously determined kinetic rate constants reveals that destabilization of deacylated tRNA in the E-site, rearrangement of peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site, and availability of cognate aa-tRNA corresponding to the A-site act synergistically to promote efficient 1 PRF. The effect of E-site codon:anticodon interactions on 1 PRF was also experimentally examined with a dual fluorescence reporter construct. The combination of predictive modeling and empirical testing allowed the rate constant for P-site tRNA slippage (k(s)) to be estimated as k(s) 1.9 s(1) for the release factor 2 (RF2) frameshifting sequence. These analyses suggest that P-site tRNA slippage is the driving force for 1 ribosomal frameshifting while the presence of a hungry codon in the A-site and destabilization in the E-site further enhance 1 PRF in E. coli. },

  Abstract                 = {The interface of protein structural biology, protein biophysics, molecular evolution, and molecular population genetics forms the foundations for a mechanistic understanding of many aspects of protein biochemistry. Current efforts in interdisciplinary protein modeling are in their infancy and the state-of-the art of such models is described. Beyond the relationship between amino acid substitution and static protein structure, protein function, and corresponding organismal fitness, other considerations are also discussed. More complex mutational processes such as insertion and deletion and domain rearrangements and even circular permutations should be evaluated. The role of intrinsically disordered proteins is still controversial, but may be increasingly important to consider. Protein geometry and protein dynamics as a deviation from static considerations of protein structure are also important. Protein expression level is known to be a major determinant of evolutionary rate and several considerations including selection at the mRNA level and the role of interaction specificity are discussed. Lastly, the relationship between modeling and needed high-throughput experimental data as well as experimental examination of protein evolution using ancestral sequence resurrection and in vitro biochemistry are presented, towards an aim of ultimately generating better models for biological inference and prediction.},

In this study, using the recoding region of insertion sequence IS3, we have investigated the influence on frameshifting in Escherichia coli of the first codon of this type of motif by changing it to all other NNA codons. Two classes of NNA codons were distinguished, depending on whether they favor or limit frameshifting. Their degree of shiftiness is correlated with wobble propensity, and base 34 modification, of their decoding tRNAs. A more flexible anticodon loop very likely makes the tRNAs with extended wobble more prone to liberate the third codon base, A, for re-pairing of tRNA(Lys) in the -1 frame. },

This enables identification of the major proteins in a tissue or subcellular fraction by mass spectrometric methods. In addition, 2D PAGE can be used to compare quantities of proteins in related samples, such as those from altered environments or from mutant and wild type, thus allowing the response of classes of proteins to be determined. Those proteins showing a correlated difference in expression may participate in related processes, and this subsequently helps to define protein function. Although there are many limitations of the 2D gel technology that mean it will never be comprehensive in protein coverage, its use for the identification of relatively abundant proteins is now widespread. However, there are still surprisingly few examples of quantitative analysis of changes in protein abundance. In this review we highlight recent advances towards true quantitative analysis of 2D gels that will lead to better prediction of protein function. Despite the development of promising alternatives, 2D PAGE is likely to remain in extensive use for the foreseeable future, because the technology is now simple and readily available to many laboratories.}

  Abstract                 = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in plants and animals. To investigate the influence of miRNAs on transcript levels, we transfected miRNAs into human cells and used microarrays to examine changes in the messenger RNA profile. Here we show that delivering miR-124 causes the expression profile to shift towards that of brain, the organ in which miR-124 is preferentially expressed, whereas delivering miR-1 shifts the profile towards that of muscle, where miR-1 is preferentially expressed. In each case, about 100 messages were downregulated after 12 h. The 3' untranslated regions of these messages had a significant propensity to pair to the 5' region of the miRNA, as expected if many of these messages are the direct targets of the miRNAs. Our results suggest that metazoan miRNAs can reduce the levels of many of their target transcripts, not just the amount of protein deriving from these transcripts. Moreover, miR-1 and miR-124, and presumably other tissue-specific miRNAs, seem to downregulate a far greater number of targets than previously appreciated, thereby helping to define tissue-specific gene expression in humans.},

This demonstrated that widespread use of adenine in the wobble position in anticodons should lead to a low efficiency of ribosomal translation, since the wobble A of the P-site {tRNA} weakens the codon-dependent binding of aminoacyl-{tRNA} at the A-site via interduplex interaction. Besides the canonical partner U, the wobble A of aminoacyl-{tRNA} can recognize A, C, G in the third position of the codon by the formation of the propeller twist in the wobble pairs AA, AC, AG. The conversion of the wobble A into inosine improves its pairing with the codon bases (the pairs IA and IC, unlike AA and AC, should not form the propeller twist leading to the deformation of base-base hydrogen bonds) and should reduce an adverse effect of the P-site wobble adenine on the formation of the A-site duplex. The consequence of the interaction between the ribosomal P- and E-site duplexes has been formulated. According to this the E-site wobble A should enhance the probability of frameshifting. These properties of the wobble A and I could be a reason why A is very rarely observed in the first anticodon position and why evolutionary processes have developed the enzyme which modifies the wobble A to I. The results obtained can be subjected to direct experimental tests. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited},

This demonstrated that only the correct duplexes at the A-site are compatible with the AP interduplex interaction. The selection of synonymous codons and anticodon wobble bases, together with the AP interduplex interaction, prevents frameshifting. In the absence of this interaction the efficiency of the selection falls off sharply. This suggests that the AP interduplex interaction should be retained during translocation and in the post-translocation state, i.e. the PE interduplex interaction that is identical with that of AP should exist to avoid frameshifting. In such a model the P-site duplex provides an indirect linkage between the A and E-site duplexes. The indirect linkage prohibits the simultaneous existence of the A and E-site duplexes. The wobble pairs of the P and E-site duplexes can affect the rate of the A-site occupation via the AP interduplex interaction and the AE interduplex indirect linkage. It is demonstrated that frameshifting can occur from the AP or PE codon-anticodon complex destabilization caused, for example, by small mobility of the wobble pairs, misreading of the codon, unmodified adenine and guanine at {tRNA} positions 34 (wobble) and 37, respectively. The results obtained can be subjected to direct experimental tests. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

In this work, on the basis of the available data, we propose that the correct codon:anticodon duplexes are those whose formation and interaction with the ribosomal decoding center are not accompanied by uncompensated losses of hydrogen and ionic bonds. Other factors such as proofreading, base-base stacking and aminoacyl-{tRNA} concentration contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of aminoacyl-{tRNA} selection, and certainly these factors are important; but we suggest that analyses of hydrogen and ionic bonding alone provides a robust first-order approximation of decoding accuracy. Thus our model can simplify predictions about decoding accuracy and error. The model can be refined with data, but is already powerful enough to explain all of the available data on decoding accuracy. Here we predict which duplexes should be considered correct, which duplexes are responsible for virtually all misreading, and we suggest an evolutionary scheme that gave rise to the mixed boxes of the genetic code. },

At the intersection of comparative genomics and systems biology lies great possibility for discovery, analysis and prediction. This paper explores this nexus and the relationship from four general levels: DNA, RNA, protein and extragenomic.

  Abstract                 = {Many Saccharomyces cerevisiae duplicate genes that were derived from an ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) unexpectedly show a small synonymous divergence (K-S), a higher sequence similarity to each other than to orthologues in Saccharomyces bayanus, or slow evolution compared with the orthologue in Kluyveromyces waltii, a non-WGD species. This decelerated evolution was attributed to gene conversion between duplicates. Using approximate to 300 WGD gene pairs in four species and their orthologues in non-WGD species, we show that codon-usage bias and protein-sequence conservation are two important causes for decelerated evolution of duplicate genes, whereas gene conversion is effective only in the presence of strong codon-usage bias or protein-sequence conservation. Furthermore, we find that change in mutation pattern or in tDNA copy number changed codon-usage bias and increased the K-S distance between K. waltii and S. cerevisiae. Intriguingly, some proteins showed fast evolution before the radiation of WGD species but little or no sequence divergence between orthologues and paralogues thereafter, indicating that functional conservation after the radiation may also be responsible for decelerated evolution in duplicates. },

  Abstract                 = {Generating adaptive immunity postinfection or immunization requires physical interaction within a lymph node T zone between Ag-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) and rare cognate T cells. Many fundamental questions remain regarding the dynamics of DC-CD4+ T cell interactions leading to priming. For example, it is not known how the production of primed CD4+ T cells relates to the numbers of cognate T cells, Ag-bearing DCs, or peptide-MHCII level on the DC. To address these questions, we developed an agent-based model of a lymph node to examine the relationships among cognate T cell frequency, DC density, parameters characterizing DC-T cell interactions, and the output of primed T cells. We found that the output of primed CD4+ T cells is linearly related to cognate frequency, but nonlinearly related to the number of Ag-bearing DCs present during infection. This addresses the applicability of two photon microscopy studies to understanding actual infection dynamics, because these types of experiments increase the cognate frequency by orders of magnitude compared with physiologic levels. We found a trade-off between the quantity of peptide-major histocompatibility class II on the surface of individual DCs and number of Ag-bearing DCs present in the lymph node in contributing to the production of primed CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, peptide-major histocompatibility class II t(1/2) plays a minor, although still significant, role in determining CD4+ T cell priming, unlike the primary role that has been suggested for CD8+ T cell priming. Finally, we identify several pathogen-targeted mechanisms that, if altered in their efficiency, can significantly effect the generation of primed CD4+ T cells.},

Heterotic genes responsible for elevating crop yields are now being sought using genomics, particularly transcriptomics, but with contradictory results. Because heterosis is an environmentally modified quantitative phenotype, genomic analyses alone will not suffice. Future research should focus on integrating genomic tools in a framework of comprehensive quantitative trait locus (QTL)-based phenotyping, followed by map-based cloning. This 'phenomics' approach should identify loci controlling heterotic phenotypes, and improve understanding of the role of heterosis in evolution and the domestication of crop plants. }

  Abstract                 = {Pathogens rarely cause extinctions of host species, and there are few examples of a pathogen changing species richness and diversity of an ecological community by causing local extinctions across a wide range of species. We report the link between the rapid appearance of a pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in an amphibian community at El Cope, Panama, and subsequent mass mortality and loss of amphibian biodiversity across eight families of frogs and salamanders. We describe an outbreak of chytridiomycosis in Panama and argue that this infectious disease has played an important role in amphibian population declines. The high virulence and large number of potential hosts of this emerging infectious disease threaten global amphibian diversity. }

  Abstract                 = {Infections have long been thought to exert natural selection on humans. Infectious disease resistance is frequently invoked as a mechanism shaping human genetic diversity, but such hypotheses have rarely been quantitatively evaluated with direct measures of disease-related mortality. Enhancement of genetically determined resistance to tuberculosis by natural selection has been proposed as a factor explaining the decline of tuberculosis in Europe and North America in the period 1830-1950 (before the advent of antimicrobial chemotherapy) and the apparently reduced susceptibility of Europeans and their descendants to tuberculosis infection and/or disease. We used Swedish vital statistics from 1891 to 1900 to estimate that individuals who escaped mortality from pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) during the European tuberculosis epidemic would have enjoyed a fitness advantage of 7-15\% per generation compared to individuals who were susceptible to PTB mortality; individuals wrath 50\% protection would have had a selection coefficient of 4-7\%/generation. Selection during the peak of the European TB epidemic could have substantially reduced the frequency of already rare alleles conferring increased susceptibility to PTB mortality, but only if the phenotypic effects of these alleles were very large. However, if resistant alleles were rare at the beginning of this period, 300 years would not have been long enough for such selection to increase their frequency to epidemiologically significant levels. Reductions in the frequency of rare susceptibility alleles could have played at most a small part in the decline of the epidemic in the century preceding 1950. Natural selection by PTB deaths during the European TB epidemic alone cannot account for the presently low level of TB disease observed among Europeans and their descendants just prior to the appearance of antibiotic treatment. }

We applied smsDGE to the transcriptome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DBY746, using 6 of the available 50 channels in a single sequencing run, yielding on average 12 million aligned reads per channel. Using spiked-in RNA, accurate quantitative measurements were obtained over four orders of magnitude. High correlation was demonstrated across independent flow-cell channels, instrument runs and sample preparations. Transcript counting in smsDGE is highly efficient due to the representation of each transcript molecule by a single read. This efficiency, coupled with the high throughput enabled by the single-molecule sequencing platform, provides an alternative method for expression profiling. },

We developed GOLPH (GenOmic Linkage to PHenotype), a statistical method to identify genetic interactions, and used it to characterize the landscape of genetic interactions between gene expression quantitative trait loci. Our results reveal that allele-specific interactions, in which a gene only exerts an influence on the phenotype in the presence of a particular allele at the primary locus, are widespread and that genetic interactions are predominantly nonadditive. The data portray a complex picture in which interacting loci influence the expression of modules of coexpressed genes involved in coherent biological processes and pathways. We show that genetic variation at a single gene can have a major impact on the global transcriptional response, altering interactions between genes through shutdown or activation of pathways. Thus, different cellular states occur not only in response to the external environment but also result from intrinsic genetic variation.},

  Abstract                 = {The relationship between codon usage and gene function was investigated while considering a dataset of 2106 nuclear genes of Oryza sativa. The results of standard X 2 test and F-statistic showed that for every 59 synonymous codons, a strongly significant association with gene functional categories existed in rice, indicating that codon usage was generally coordinated with gene function whether it was at the level of individual amino acids or at the level of nucleotides. However, it could not be directly said that the use of every codons differed significantly between any two functional categories. Notably, there existed large difference both in selection for biased codons or selection intensity among functional categories. Therefore, we identified at least two classes of genes: one group of genes, mainly belonging to the "METABOLISM" category, was tended to use Gand/or C-ending codons while the other was more biased to choose codons ending with A and/or U. The latter group contained genes of various functions, especially those genes classified into the "Nuclear Structure" category. These observations will be more important for molecular genetic engineering and genome functional annotation. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. },

  Abstract                 = {This short review portrays the evolutionary theories of aging in the light of the existing discoveries from genomic and molecular genetic studies on aging and longevity. At the outset, an historical background for the development of the evolutionary theories of aging is presented through the works of August Weismann ( programmed death and the germ plasm theories) including his exceptional theoretical postulation, later experimentally validated by the existence of cell division limits. Afterwards, the theory of mutation accumulation of Peter Medawar and the theory modification by Charlesworth (late-life mortality plateau) are presented as well as the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis of George Williams, and the disposable soma theory of Kirkwood and Holliday. These theories are discussed in the light of the different research studies, which include studies on insulin signaling and longevity, the possibility that nuclear factor kappa B may be a major mediator of aging, studies of anti-aging Sirtuins and studies on heat shock proteins and longevity and on gene sets as biomarkers of aging. Finally, the proposals for future research in biogerontology, such as studies on the control of protein synthesis, validation of biomarkers of aging, understanding the biochemistry of longevity and research in the field of gerontologic pathology are presented. Likewise, further attention is suggested regarding the work on telomere shortening, stem cells and studies on understanding the biochemical and molecular basis for longevity in centenarians.

  Abstract                 = {In many organisms, synonymous codon usage is biased by a history of natural selection. However, codon bias, itself, does not indicate that selection is ongoing; it may be a vestige of past selection. Simple statistical tests have been devised to infer ongoing selection on codon usage by comparing the derived state frequency spectra at polymorphic sites segregating either derived preferred codons or derived unpreferred codons; if selection is effective, the frequency of derived states should be higher in the former. We propose a new test that uses the inferred degree of preference, essentially calculating the correlation of derived state frequency and the difference in preference between the derived and the ancestral states; the correlation should be positive if selection is effective. When implementing the test, derived and ancestral states can be assigned by parsimony or on the basis of relative probability. In either case, statistical significance is estimated by a simple permutation test. We explored the statistical power of the test by sampling polymorphism data from 14 loci in 16 strains of D. simulans, finding that the test retains 80\% power even when quite a few of the data are discarded. The power of the test likely reflects better use of multiple features of the data, combining population frequencies of polymorphic variants and quantitative estimates of codon preferences. We also applied this novel test to 14 newly sequenced loci in five strains of D. mauritiana, showing for the first time ongoing selection on codon usage in this species.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimation of viral parameters, such as the basic reproductive number (R-0) and infected cell life span, is central to the quantitative study of the within-host dynamics of viral diseases such as human immunodeficiency) virus, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. As these parameters can rarely be determined directly, they are usually estimated indirectly by fitting mathematical models to viral load data. This paper investigates how parameter estimates obtained by such procedures depend on the assumptions made concerning the viral life cycle. It finds that estimates of the basic reproductive e number obtained using viral load data collected during the initial stages of infection can depend quite sensitive on these assumptions. The use of models which neglect the intracellular delay before virion production can lead to set ere underestimates of R-0 and, hence, to overly optimistic predictions of how efficacious treatment must be in order to prevent or eradicate the disease. These results are also of importance for attempts at estimating R-0 from similar epidemiological data as there is a correspondence between within-host and between-host models. Estimates of the life span of infected cells obtained from viral load data collected during drug treatment studies also depend on the assumptions made in modelling the virus life cycle. The use of more realistic descriptions of the life cycle is seen to increase estimates of infected cell life span, in addition to providing a new explanation for the shoulder phase seen during drug treatment. This study highlights the limitations of what can be learnt by fitting mathematical models to infectious disease data T without detailed independent knowledge of the life cycle of the infectious agent.}

When there is seasonal variation in disease transmission this destabilization leads to the appearance of complex dynamical patterns with much lower levels of seasonality than previously predicted.

The effects of including more realistic descriptions of the infectious period within SIR (susceptible/infectious/recovered) models are studied. Less dispersed distributions are seen to have two important epidemiological consequences. First, less stable behaviour is seen within the model: incidence patterns become more complex. Second, disease persistence is diminished: in models with a finite population, the minimum population size needed to allow disease persistence increases. The assumption made concerning the infectious period distribution is of a kind routinely made in the formulation of mathematical models in population biology. Since it has a major eff ect on the central issues of population persistence and dynamics, the results of this study have broad implications for mathematical modellers of a wide range of biological systems.

The performance of the approximations are assessed using analytic techniques available for the simplest epidemiological model and using numerical simulations in more complex settings. We also present epidemiologically important extensions of previous work, considering variability in the SEIR model and in situations for which there is seasonal variation in disease transmission. Important implications of stochastic effects for the dynamics of childhood diseases are highlighted, including serious deficiencies of deterministic descriptions of dynamical behavior.

Immune system strength is clearly important in fending off pathogen attack. Physical barriers to pathogen entry are also important. Various individual behaviors are efficacious in reducing contact with diseases and pests. This paper focuses on a fourth mode of defense: social barriers to transmission. Various social behaviors have pathogen transmission consequences. Selective pressures on these social behaviors may therefore exist. Effects on pathogen transmission of mating strategies, social avoidance, group size, group isolation, and other behaviors are explored. It is concluded that many of these behaviors may have been affected by selection pressures to reduce transmission of pathogens. },

Of the 575 unique proteins identified, 42\% were found to exist in multiple forms. Using DIGE, we also examined the relative changes in protein expression when cells were grown in the presence and absence of amino acids. A total of 23 different proteins were identified whose abundance changed significantly between the two conditions. Most of these changes were found to be associated with proteins involved in carbon and amino acid metabolism, transport, and chemotaxis. Detailed information related to all 2,160 protein forms ( protein and gene names, accession numbers, subcellular locations, relative abundances, sequence coverage, molecular masses, and isoelectric points) can be obtained upon request in either tabular form or as interactive gel images.},

  Abstract                 = {Cyathostomes are now the principle parasitic pathogen of the horse: a remarkable transformation during the last 25 years from virtual obscurity to focus of attention in equine parasitology. This rise to prominence coincides with the marked decrease in prevalence of large strongyle infections as a result of widespread use of modern anthelmintic compounds. On the basis that strongyle-associated diseases continue to commonly occur in the absence of these large strongyle species, clinical attention has turned to the pathogenicity of cyathostomes, Although many horses harbour burdens of tens of thousands of cyathostomes without developing detectable illness, these parasites can result in an inflammatory enteropathy affecting the caecum and colon. Although the principle clinical effect of cyathostomosis is weight loss, affected individuals may exhibit other signs including diarrhoea and/or subcutaneous oedema and/or pyrexia. Clinical cyathostomosis occurs more commonly in young horses in late winter/early spring but there is lifelong susceptibility to cyathostomes and they can cause clinical disease in any age of horse during any season. Animals with cyathostomosis often develop hypoalbuminaemia and/or neutrophilia but there are no clinicopathological features specific for the disease. Experimental infections with cyathostomes have resulted in both clinical and pathological features similar to those of naturally-occuring cyathostomosis cases. From the experimental infection studies, it is evident that cyathostomes are pathogenic at times of both penetration into and emergence from the large intestinal mucose. An unusual feature of cyathostome biology is the propensity for arrested larval development within the large intestinal mucosa for more than 2 years. From limited studies it appears that this arrested larval development is favoured by: feedback from luminal to mucosal worms; larger size of challenge dose of larvae and trickle (versus single bolus) infection. During arrested larval development cyathostomes have minimal susceptibility to all anthelmintic compounds. thus, limiting the effectiveness of therapeutic and/or control strategies, Although, the relative importance of individual cyathostomes is not known, the development of species-specific DNA methods for identification of cyathostomes provides a means by which the pathogenicity of different species might be established.

  Abstract                 = {Background: In testing for differential gene expression involving multiple serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) libraries, it is critical to account for both between and within library variation. Several methods have been proposed, including the t test, t(w) test, and an overdispersed logistic regression approach. The merits of these tests, however, have not been fully evaluated. Questions still remain on whether further improvements can be made. Results: In this article, we introduce an overdispersed log-linear model approach to analyzing SAGE; we evaluate and compare its performance with three other tests: the two-sample t test, t(w) test and another based on overdispersed logistic linear regression. Analysis of simulated and real datasets show that both the log-linear and logistic overdispersion methods generally perform better than the t and t(w) tests; the log-linear method is further found to have better performance than the logistic method, showing equal or higher statistical power over a range of parameter values and with different data distributions. Conclusion: Overdispersed log-linear models provide an attractive and reliable framework for analyzing SAGE experiments involving multiple libraries. For convenience, the implementation of this method is available through a user-friendly web-interface available at http://www.cbcb.duke.edu/sage.}

APEX relies upon correcting each protein's mass spectrometry sampling depth (observed peptide count) by learned probabilities for identifying the peptides. APEX abundances agree with measurements from controls, western blotting, flow cytometry and two-dimensional gels, as well as known correlations with {mRNA} abundances and codon bias, providing absolute protein concentrations across approximately three to four orders of magnitude. Using APEX, we demonstrate that 73\% of the variance in yeast protein abundance (47\% in \emph{{E}.~coli}) is explained by {mRNA} abundance, with the number of proteins per {mRNA} log-normally distributed about similar to 5,600 (similar to 540 in E. coli) protein molecules/ {mRNA}. Therefore, levels of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are set per {mRNA} molecule and independently of overall protein concentration, with > 70\% of yeast gene expression regulation occurring through {mRNA}-directed mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Complex cellular machines and processes are commonly believed to be products of selection, and it is typically understood to be the job of evolutionary biologists to show how selective advantage can account for each step in their origin and subsequent growth in complexity. Here, we describe how complex machines might instead evolve in the absence of positive selection through a process of "presuppression," first termed constructive neutral evolution (CNE) more than a decade ago. If an autonomously functioning cellular component acquires mutations that make it dependent for function on another, preexisting component or process, and if there are multiple ways in which such dependence may arise, then dependence inevitably will arise and reversal to independence is unlikely. Thus, CNE is a unidirectional evolutionary ratchet leading to complexity, if complexity is equated with the number of components or steps necessary to carry out a cellular process. CNE can explain "functions" that seem to make little sense in terms of cellular economy, like RNA editing or splicing, but it may also contribute to the complexity of machines with clear benefit to the cell, like the ribosome, and to organismal complexity overall. We suggest that CNE-based evolutionary scenarios are in these and other cases less forced than the selectionist or adaptationist narratives that are generally told.

During the four decades that followed, investigations have focused on the gene--how mutations specifically alter DNA and how these changes affect the structure and expression of encoded proteins. Recently, however, the advances of the human genome project and the completion of total genome sequences for yeast and many bacterial species, have enabled investigators to view genetic information in the context of the entire genome. As a result, we recognize that the mechanisms for some genetic diseases are best understood at a genomic level. The evolution of the mammalian genome has resulted in the duplication of genes, gene segments and repeat gene clusters. This genome architecture provides substrates for homologous recombination between nonsyntenic regions of chromosomes. Such events can result in DNA rearrangements that cause disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Rearrangements of our genome can be responsible for inherited as well as sporadic traits. The analyses of chromosome breakpoints in the proximal short arm of Chromosome 17 (17p) reveal nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) as a major mechanism for recurrent rearrangements whereas nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) can be responsible for man), of the nonrecurrent rearrangements. Genome architectural features consisting of low-copy repeats (LCRs), or segmental duplications, can stimulate and mediate NAHR, and there are hotspots for the crossovers within the LCRs. Rearrangements introduce variation into our genome for selection to act upon and as such serve an evolutionary function analogous to base pair changes. Genomic rearrangements may cause Mendelian diseases, produce complex traits such as behaviors, or represent benign polymorphic changes. The mechanisms by which rearrangements convey phenotypes are diverse and include gene dosage, gene interruption, generation of a fusion gene, position effects, unmasking of recessive coding region mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs, in coding DNA) or other functional SNPs, and perhaps by effects on transvection.},

It is shown here that the conclusions of this prior work are an artifact of unwarranted biological assumptions, inappropriate mathematical modeling, and faulty logic. Numerous simple pathways exist by which adaptive multi-residue functions can evolve on time scales or a million years (or much less) in populations of only moderate size. Thus, the classical evolutionary trajectory of descent with modification is adequate to explain the diversification of protein functions. },

This narrow view of evolution has become untenable in light of recent observations from genomic sequencing and population-genetic theory. Numerous aspects of genomic architecture, gene structure, and developmental pathways are difficult to explain without invoking the nonadaptive forces of genetic drift and mutation. In addition, emergent biological features such as complexity, modularity, and evolvability, all of which are current targets of considerable speculation, may be nothing more than indirect by-products of processes operating at lower levels of organization. These issues are examined in the context of the view that the origins of many aspects of biological diversity, from gene-structural embellishments to novelties at the phenotypic level, have roots in nonadaptive processes, with the population-genetic environment imposing strong directionality on the paths that are open to evolutionary exploitation. },

Observations from the genomic databases for several eukaryotic species suggest that duplicate genes arise at a very high rate, on average 0.01 per gene per million years. Most duplicated genes experience a brief period of relaxed selection early in their history, with a moderate fraction of them evolving in an effectively neutral manner during this period. However, the vast majority of gene duplicates are silenced within a few million years, with the few survivors subsequently experiencing strong purifying selection. Although duplicate genes may only rarely evolve new functions, the stochastic silencing of such genes may play a significant role in the passive origin of new species. },

We argue that many of these modi. cations emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies. },

  Abstract                 = {It has often been argued that gene-duplication events are most commonly followed by a mutational event that silences one member of the pair, while on rare occasions both members of the pair are preserved as one acquires a mutation with a beneficial function and the other retains the original function. However, empirical evidence from genome duplication events suggests that gene duplicates are preserved in genomes far more commonly and for periods far in excess of the expectations under this model, and whereas some gene duplicates clearly evolve new functions, there is little evidence that this is the most common mechanism of duplicate-gene preservation. An alternative hypothesis is that gene duplicates are frequently preserved by subfunctionalization, whereby both members of a pair experience degenerative mutations that reduce their joint levels and patterns of activity to that of the single ancestral gene. We consider the ways in which thf probability of duplicate-gene preservation by such complementary mutations is modified by aspects of gene structure, degree of linkage, mutation rates and effects, and population size. Even if most mutations cause complete loss-of-subfunction, the probability of duplicate-gene preservation can be appreciable if the long-term effective population size is on the order of 10(5) or smaller, especially if ther are more than two, independently mutable subfunctions per locus. Even a moderate incidence of partial loss-of-function mutations greatly elevates the probability of preservation, nle model proposed herein leads to quantitative predictions that are consistent with observations on die frequency of long-term duplicate gene preservation and with observations that indicate tl-lat a common fate of the members of duplicate-gene pairs is the partitioning of tissue-specific patterns of expression of die ancestral gene. },

  Abstract                 = {Newly emerging data from genome sequencing projects suggest that gene duplication, often accompanied by genetic map changes, is a common and ongoing feature of all genomes. This raises the possibility that differential expansion/contraction of various genomic sequences may be just as important a mechanism of phenotypic evolution as changes at the nucleotide level. However, the population-genetic mechanisms responsible for the success vs. failure of newly arisen gene duplicates are poorly understood. We examine the influence of various aspects of gene structure, mutation rates, degree of linkage, and population size (N) on the joint fate of a newly arisen duplicate gene and its ancestral locus. Unless there is active selection against duplicate genes, the probability of permanent establishment of such genes is usually no less than 1/(4N) (half of the neutral expectation), and it can be orders of magnitude greater if neofunctionalizing mutations are common. The probability of a map change (reassignment of a key function of an ancestral locus to a new chromosomal location) induced by a newly arisen duplicate is also generally >1/(4N) for unlinked duplicates, suggesting that recurrent gene duplication and alternative silencing may be a common mechanism for generating microchromosomal rearrangements responsible for postreproductive isolating barriers among species. Relative to subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization is expected to become a progressively more important mechanism of duplicate-gene preservation in populations with increasing size. However, even in large populations, the probability of neofunctionalization scales only with the square of the selective advantage. Tight linkage also influences the probability of duplicate-gene preservation, increasing the probability of subfunctionalization but decreasing the probability of neofunctionalization.},

Our results confirm some findings previously obtained by indirect methods but also yield numerous unexpected findings, in particular a very high rate of point mutation and skewed distribution of base-substitution types in the mitochondrion, a very high rate of segmental duplication and deletion in the nuclear genome, and substantial deviations in the mutational profile among various model organisms. },

A significant positive correlation of the presence of an SD sequence and the predicted expression level of a gene based on codon usage biases was ascertained, such that predicted highly expressed genes are more likely to possess a strong SD sequence than average genes. Genes with AUG start codons are more likely than genes with other start codons, GUG or UUG, to possess an SD sequence. Genes in close proximity to upstream genes on the same coding strand in most genomes are significantly higher in SD presence. In light of these results, we discuss the role of the SD sequence in translation initiation and its relationship with predicted gene expression levels and with operon structure in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.}

Dissection of complex traits using the powerful genetic approaches available with Drosophila melanogaster has provided important lessons that should be considered when studying human complex traits. In Drosophila, large numbers of pleiotropic genes affect complex traits; quantitative trait locus alleles often have sex-, environment-, and genetic background-specific effects, and variants associated with different phenotypic are in noncoding as well as coding regions of candidate genes. Such insights, in conjunction with the strong evolutionary conservation of key genes and pathways between flies and humans, make Drosophila an excellent model system for elucidating the genetic mechanisms that affect clinically relevant human complex traits, such as alcohol dependence, sleep, and neurodegenerative diseases. }

The ease with which QTL can be mapped to genomic intervals bounded by molecular markers belies the difficulty in matching the QTL to a genetic locus. The latter requires high-resolution recombination or linkage disequilibrium mapping to nominate putative candidate genes, followed by genetic and/or functional complementation and gene expression analyses. Complete genome sequences and improved technologies for polymorphism detection will greatly advance the genetic dissection of quantitative traits in model organisms, which will open avenues for exploration of homologous QTL in related taxa. }

Translation of individual {mRNA} species into their encoded proteins is regulated, producing discrepancies between {mRNA} and protein levels. Using a new modeling approach to data analysis, a striking diversity is revealed in association of the transcriptome with the translational machinery. Each {mRNA} has its own pattern of ribosome loading, a circumstance that provides an extraordinary dynamic range of regulation, above and beyond actual transcript levels. Using this approach together with quantitative proteomics, we explored the immediate changes in gene expression in response to activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in yeast by mating pheromone. Interestingly, in 26\% of those transcripts where the predicted protein synthesis rate changed by at least 3-fold, more than half of these changes resulted from altered translational efficiencies. These observations underscore that analysis of transcript level, albeit extremely important, is insufficient by itself to describe completely the phenotypes of cells under different conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Matings between different Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeast species produce sexually sterile hybrids, so individuals should avoid mating with other species. Any mechanism that reduces the frequency of interspecific matings will confer a selective advantage. Here we test the ability of two closely-related Saccharomyces sensu stricto species to select their own species as mates and avoid hybridisation. Results: We set up mate choice tests, using five independently isolated pairs of species, in which individual germinating spores were presented with the opportunity to mate either with a germinating spore of their own species or with a germinating spore of the other species. For all five strain pairs, whether a S. cerevisiae or S. paradoxus occupies the role of "chooser" strain, the level of hybridisation that is observed between the two species is significantly lower than would be expected if mates were selected at random. We also show that, overall, S. cerevisiae exhibited a stronger own-species preference than S. paradoxus. Conclusion: Prezygotic reproductive isolation is well known in higher organisms but has been largely overlooked in yeast, an important model microbe. Here we present the first report of prezygotic reproductive isolation in Saccharomyces. Prezygotic reproductive isolation may be important in yeast speciation or yeast species cohesion, and may have evolved to prevent wasted matings between different species. Whilst yeast has long been used as a genetic model system, little is known about yeast in the wild. Our work sheds light on an interesting aspect of yeast natural behaviour: their ability to avoid costly interspecific matings. },

  Abstract                 = {The effect of recurrent selective sweeps is a spatially heterogeneous reduction in neutral polymorphism throughout the genome. The pattern of reduction depends oil the selective advantage and recurrence rate of the sweeps. Because many adaptive substitutions responsible for these sweeps also contribute to non-synonymous divergence, the spatial distribution of non-synonymous divergence also reflects the distribution of adaptive substitutions. Thus, the spatial correspondence between neutral polymorphism and non-synonymous divergence may be especially informative about the process of adaptation. Here we study this 1 0 correspondence using genomewide polymorphism data from Drosophila simulans and the divergence between D. simulans and D. melanogaster: Focusing on highly recombining portions of the autosomes, at a spatial scale appropriate to the study of selective sweeps, we find that. neutral polymorphism is both lower and, as measured by a new statistic Qs, less homogeneous where non-synonymous divergence is higher and that the spatial structure of this correlation is best explained by the action of strong recurrent selective sweeps. We introduce a method to infer, from the spatial correspondence between polymorphism and divergence, the rate and selective strength of adaptation. Our results independently confirm a high rate of adaptive substitution (similar to 1/3000 generations) and newly suggest. that many adaptations are of surprisingly great selective effect (similar to 1\%), reducing the effective population size by similar to 15\% even in highly recombining regions of the genome.},

  Abstract                 = {A continuous-time and deterministic model was used to characterize plant virus disease epidemics in relation to virus transmission mechanism and population dynamics of the insect vectors. The model can be written as a set of linked differential equations for healthy (virus-free), latently infected, infectious, and removed (postinfectious) plant categories, and virus-free, latent, and infective insects, with parameters based on the transmission classes, vector population dynamics, immigration/emigration rates, and virus-plant interactions. The rate of change in diseased plants is a function of the density of infective insects, the number of plants visited per time, and the probability of transmitting the virus per plant visit. The rate of change in infective insects is a function of the density of infectious plants, the number of plants visited per time by an insect, and the probability of acquiring the virus per plant visit. Numerical solutions of the differential equations were used to determine transitional and steady-state levels of disease incidence (d*); d* was also determined directly from the model parameters. Clear differences were found in disease development among the four transmission classes: nonpersistently transmitted (stylet borne [NP]); semipersistently transmitted (foregut-borne [SP]); circulative, persistently transmitted (CP); and propagative, persistently transmitted (PP), with the highest disease incidence (d) for the SP and CP classes relative to the others, especially at low insect density when there was no insect migration or when the vector status of emigrating insects was the same as that of immigrating ones. The PP and CP viruses were most affected by changes in vector longevity, rates of acquisition, and inoculation of the virus by vectors, whereas the PP viruses were least affected by changes in insect mobility. When vector migration was explicitly considered, results depended on the fraction of infective insects in the immigration pool and the fraction of dying and emigrating vectors replaced by immigrants. The PP and CP viruses were most sensitive to changes in these factors. Based on model parameters, the basic reproductive number (R-0)-number of new infected plants resulting from an infected plant introduced into a susceptible plans population-was derived for some circumstances and used to determine the steady-state level of disease incidence and an approximate exponential rate of disease increase early in the epidemic. Results can be used to evaluate disease management strategies.}

However, even for the best-studied organism, \emph{Escherichia coli}, a large number of proteins have never been identified and characterised from wild-type cells, and/or await unravelling of their biological role. Instead, the ORF models for these proteins have been predicted by suitable algorithms and/or through comparison with known, homologous proteins from other organisms, approaches which may be prone to error. In the present study, we used a combination of 2-DE, MALDI-TOF-MS and PMF to identify 1151 different proteins in E. coli K12 JM109. Comparison of the experimental with the theoretical M-r and pI values (4000 experimental values each) allowed the identification of numerous proteins with incorrect or incomplete ORF annotations in the current E. coli genome databases. Several inconsistencies in genome annotation were verified experimentally, and up to 55 candidates await further investigation. Our findings demonstrate how an. up-to-date 2-D gel-based proteornics approach can be used for improving the annotation of prokaryotic genomes. They also highlight the need for harmonization among the different E. coli genome databases. },

Induction of 23S rRNAs mutated at G2582 and G2583 lead to a drastic reduction in cell growth. In addition, mutations G2582A and G2583C reduced to one-third the total protein synthesis but not the RNA synthesis. Finally, we show that 23S rRNA mutations G2582A, G2582U, and G2583C cause a significant increase in peptidyl-{tRNA} drop-off from ribosomes, thereby reducing translational processivity.

Four of the animals cleared HCV; 6 developed persistent infections. All animals developed similar acute infections with increasing viremia from 1 to 2 weeks, followed by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations and seroconversion. This viremia pattern consisted of a biphasic increase, a rapid slope (mean doubling time [t(2)] = 0.5 days) followed by a slower slope after the second week (t(2) = 7.5 days). This slowing of virus replication correlated in all animals with increased intrahepatic 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (2OAS-1) messenger RNA ({mRNA}) levels and was independent of disease outcome. An effective control of virus replication was observed following increases in intrahepatic interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) {mRNA} and ALT levels. Although this control was associated in all animals with a 2-log decrease in virus titer, the timing occurred approximately 2 weeks later in, the chronic group (P < .05). Additionally, while cleared infections were characterized by a continual decrease in virus titer, the titers in the persistent infections reached a steady state level of 10(4) to 10(5) RNA copies/mL. This inability of the immune response to sustain viral clearance in the persistent infections was associated with a reduced intrahepatic CD3e and monocyte-induced protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha) {mRNA} induction. In conclusion, these data indicate that, regardless of outcome, chimpanzees generate responses that control HCV replication during the early and late acute phase. However, the pathogenesis of HCV may be determined by a more rapid onset of the induced response and the cell population that migrates to the liver. }

While directional selection tends to reduce within-population genetic diversity and increase among-population differentiation, the reverse is expected under balancing selection. To identify targets of natural selection in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) genome, 103 microsatellite and two indel markers including expressed sequence tags (EST) and quantitative trait loci (QTL)-associated loci, were genotyped in four freshwater and three marine populations. The results indicated that a high proportion of loci (14.7\%) might be affected by balancing selection and a lower proportion (2.8\%) by directional selection. The strongest signatures of directional selection were detected in a microsatellite locus and two indel markers located in the intronic regions of the Eda-gene coding for the number of lateral plates. Yet, other microsatellite loci previously found to be informative in QTL-mapping studies revealed no signatures of selection. Two novel microsatellite loci (Stn12 and Stn90) located in chromosomes I and VIII, respectively, showed signals of directional selection and might be linked to genomic regions containing gene(s) important for adaptive divergence. Although the coverage of the total genomic content was relatively low, the predominance of balancing selection signals is in agreement with the contention that balancing, rather than directional selection is the predominant mode of selection in the wild. }

  Abstract                 = {Background: In this study, we present a robust and reliable computational method for tag-to-gene assignment in serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). The method relies on current genome information and annotation, incorporation of several new features, and key improvements over alternative methods, all of which are important to determine gene expression levels more accurately. The method provides a complete annotation of potential virtual SAGE tags within a genome, along with an estimation of their confidence for experimental observation that ranks tags that present multiple matches in the genome. Results: We applied this method to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, producing the most thorough and accurate annotation of potential virtual SAGE tags that is available today for this organism. The usefulness of this method is exemplified by the significant reduction of ambiguous cases in existing experimental SAGE data. In addition, we report new insights from the analysis of existing SAGE data. First, we found that experimental SAGE tags mapping onto introns, intronexon boundaries, and noncoding RNA elements are observed in all available SAGE data. Second, a significant fraction of experimental SAGE tags was found to map onto genomic regions currently annotated as intergenic. Third, a significant number of existing experimental SAGE tags for yeast has been derived from truncated cDNAs, which are synthesized through oligo-d(T) priming to internal poly-(A) regions during reverse transcription. Conclusion: We conclude that an accurate and unambiguous tag mapping process is essential to increase the quality and the amount of information that can be extracted from SAGE experiments. This is supported by the results obtained here and also by the large impact that the erroneous interpretation of these data could have on downstream applications. },

Several statistical tests have been developed to detect significant differences in tag frequency between two samples. However, which one of these tests has the greatest power to detect real changes remains undetermined. Results: This paper compares three statistical tests for detecting significant changes of gene expression in SAGE experiments. The comparison makes use of Monte Carlo simulation that, in essence, generates 'virtual' SAGE experiments. Our analysis shows that the Chi-square test has the best power and robustness. Since the POWER-SAGE program can easily run 'virtual' SAGE studies with different combinations of sample size and tag frequency and determine the power for each combination, it can serve as a useful tool for planning SAGE experiments. },

  Abstract                 = {It has been claimed that proteins with more interacting partners (hubs) are structurally more disordered and have a slow evolutionary rate. Here, in this paper we analyzed the evolutionary rate and structural disorderness of human hub and non-hub proteins present/absent in protein complexes. We observed that both non-hub and hub proteins present in protein complexes, are characterized by high structural disorderness. There exists no significant difference in average evolutionary rate of complex-forming hub and non-hub proteins while we have found a significant difference in the average evolutionary rate between hub and non-hub proteins which are not present in protein complexes. We concluded that higher disorderness in complex forming non-hub proteins facilitates higher number of interactions with a large number of protein subunits. High interaction among protein subunits of complex forming non-hub proteins imposes a selective constraint on their evolutionary rate. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. },

However, it remains unclear whether natural selection acts at the level of the speed or the accuracy of {mRNA}s translation. Here we show that codon usage can improve the fidelity of protein synthesis in multicellular species. As predicted by the model of selection for translational accuracy, we find that the frequency of codons optimal for translation is significantly higher at codons encoding for conserved amino acids than at codons encoding for nonconserved amino acids in 548 genes compared between Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens. Although this model predicts that codon bias correlates positively with gene length, a negative correlation between codon bias and gene length has been observed in eukaryotes. This suggests that selection for fidelity of protein synthesis is not the main factor responsible for codon biases. The relationship between codon bias and gene length remains unexplained. Exploring the differences in gene expression process in eukaryotes and prokaryotes should provide new insights to understand this key question of codon usage.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the factors responsible for variations in mutation patterns and selection efficacy along chromosomes is a prerequisite for deciphering genome sequences. Population genetics models predict a positive correlation between the efficacy of selection at a given locus and the local rate of recombination because of Hill-Robertson effects. Codon usage is considered one of the most striking examples that support this prediction at the molecular level. in a wide range of species including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, codon usage is essentially shaped by selection acting for translational efficiency. Codon usage bias correlates positively with recombination rate in Drosophila, apparently supporting the hypothesis that selection on codon usage is improved by recombination. Here we present an exhaustive analysis of codon usage in C. elegans and D. melanogaster complete genomes. We show that in both genomes there is a positive correlation between recombination rate and the frequency of optimal codons, However, we demonstrate that in both species, this effect is due to a mutational bias toward G and C bases in regions of high recombination rate, possibly as a direct consequence of the recombination process. The correlation between codon usage bias and recombination rate in these species appears to be essentially determined by recombination-dependent mutational patterns, rather than selective effects. This result highlights that it is necessary to take into account the mutagenic effect of recombination to understand the evolutionary role and impact of recombination. },

For each genome, the complete set of {tRNA}s required to read the 61 sense codons was identified, which permitted revelation of three major anticodon-sparing strategies. Other features and sequence peculiarities analyzed are the following: (1) fit to the standard cloverleaf structure, (2) characteristic consensus sequences for elongator and initiator tDNAs, (3) frequencies of bases at each sequence position, (4) type and frequencies of conserved 2D and 3D base pairs, (5) anticodon/tDNA usages and anticodon-sparing strategies, (6) identification of the {tRNA}-Ile with anticodon CAU reading AUA, (7) size of variable arm, (8) occurrence and location of introns, (9) occurrence of 3'-CCA and 5'-extra G encoded at the tDNA level, and (10) distribution of the {tRNA} genes in genomes and their mode of transcription. Among all {tRNA} isoacceptors, we found that initiator tDNA-iMet is the most conserved across the three domains, yet domain-specific signatures exist. Also, according to which {tRNA} feature is considered (5'-extra G encoded in tDNAs-His, AUA codon read by {tRNA}-Ile with anticodon CAU, presence of intron, absence of "two-out-of-three" reading mode and short V-arm in tDNA-Tyr) Archaea sequester either with Bacteria or Eukarya. No common features between Eukarya and Bacteria not shared with Archaea could be unveiled.

Investigators using SAGE rely heavily on the quantitative aspect of this method for cataloging gene expression and comparing multiple SAGE libraries. We have developed additional computational and statistical tools to assess the quality and reproducibility of a SAGE library. Using these methods, a critical variable in the SAGE protocol was identified that has the potential to bias the Tag distribution relative to the GC content of the 10 bp SAGE Tag DNA sequence. We also detected this bias in a number of publicly available SAGE libraries. It is important to note that the GC content bias went undetected by quality control procedures in the current SAGE protocol and was only identified with the use of these statistical analyses on as few as 750 SAGE Tags. In addition to keeping any solution of free DiTags on ice, an analysis of the GC content should be performed before sequencing large numbers of SAGE Tags to be confident that SAGE libraries are free from experimental bias.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past decade there has been a revolution in the understanding and care of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)-associated disease. Much of this progress stems from a broader recognition of the importance of differences in viral types, including receptor preference(s), replication properties, and reservoirs, as contributing factors to immunosuppresion and disease progression. In contrast, there is limited conceptualizatin of viral diversity and turnover in the brain and circulation in relation to neurocognitive impairments. Herein, the authors review current concepts regarding viral molecular diversity and phenotypes together with features of HIV-1 neuroinvasion, neurotropism, neurovirulence, and neurosusceptiblity. Viral genetic and antigenic diversity is reduced within the brain compared to blood or other systemic organs within individuals. Conversely, viral molecular heterogeneity is greater in patients with HIV-associated dementia compared to nondemented patients, depending on the viral gene examined. Individual viral proteins exert multiple neuropathogenic effects, although the neurological consequences of different viral polymorphisms remain uncertain. Nonetheless, host genetic polymorphisms clearly influence neurological disease outcomes and likely dictate both acquired and innate immune responses, which in turn shape viral evolution within the host. Emerging issues include widespread antiretroviral therapy resistance and increasing awareness of viral superinfections together with viral recombination, all of which are likely to impact on both HIV genetic variation and neuropathogenesis. With the increasing prevalence of HIV-induced neurocognitive disabilities, despite marked improvements in managing immunosuppression, it remains imperative to fully define and understand the mechanisms by which viral dynamics and diversity contribute to neurological disease, permitting the development of new therapeutic strategies. },

In tandem with this accumulation of sequence data, worldwide structural genomics initiatives, advanced by the development of improved technologies in X-ray crystallography and NMR, are expanding our knowledge of structural families and increasing our fold libraries. Methods for detecting remote sequence similarities have also been made more sensitive and this means that we can map domains from these structural families onto genome sequences to understand how these families are distributed throughout the genomes and reveal how they might influence the functional repertoires and biological complexities of the organisms. We have used robust protocols to assign sequences from completed genomes to domain structures in the CATH database, allowing up to 60\% of domain sequences in these genomes, depending on the organism, to be assigned to a domain family of known structure. Analysis of the distribution of these families throughout bacterial genomes identified more than 300 universal families, some of which had expanded significantly in proportion to genome size. These highly expanded families are primarily involved in metabolism and regulation and appear to make major contributions to the functional repertoire and complexity of bacterial organisms. When comparisons are made across all kingdoms of life, we find a smaller set of universal domain families (approx. 140), of which families involved in protein biosynthesis are the largest conserved component. Analysis of the behaviour of other families reveals that some (e.g. those involved in metabolism, regulation) have remained highly innovative during evolution, making it harder to trace their evolutionary ancestry. Structural analyses of metabolic families provide some insights into the mechanisms of functional innovation, which include changes in domain partnerships and significant structural embellishments leading to modulation of active sites and protein interactions. },

  Abstract                 = {Most cells on earth exist in a quiescent state. In yeast, quiescence is induced by carbon starvation, and exit occurs when a carbon source becomes available. To understand how cells survive in, and exit from this state, {mRNA} abundance was examined using oligonucleotide-based microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cells in stationary-phase cultures exhibited a coordinated response within 5-10 min of refeeding. Levels of >1800 {mRNA}s increased dramatically (>or=64-fold), and a smaller group of stationary-phase {mRNA}s decreased in abundance. Motif analysis of sequences upstream of genes clustered by VxInsight identified an overrepresentation of Rap1p and BUF (RPA) binding sites in genes whose {mRNA} levels rapidly increased during exit. Examination of 95 strains carrying deletions in stationary-phase genes induced identified 32 genes essential for survival in stationary-phase at 37 degrees C. Analysis of these genes suggests that mitochondrial function is critical for entry into stationary-phase and that posttranslational modifications and protection from oxidative stress become important later. The phylogenetic conservation of stationary-phase genes, and our findings that two-thirds of the essential stationary-phase genes have human homologues and of these, many have human homologues that are disease related, demonstrate that yeast is a bona fide model system for studying the quiescent state of eukaryotic cells.},

Therefore, a series of events unfold during meiosis, including pairing, synapsis, and recombination between homologous chromosomes, to ultimately ensure the successful completion of this task. This review will focus on how the regulation of crossover recombination events between homologous chromosomes plays a key role in promoting faithful segregation. Although our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which crossovers are formed has increased significantly, the mechanisms governing the distribution of crossovers along meiotic chromosomes remain largely mysterious. Here, we review the different levels of apparent control of meiotic crossover formation and distribution. },

We demonstrated highly reproducible gene expression profiling by the SuperSAGE array for 1,000 genes ( tags) in rice. We also applied this technology to the detailed study of expressed genes identified by SuperSAGE in Nicotiana benthamiana, an organism for which sufficient genome sequence information is not available.

Model D: Sterilizing effects: e.g. of \textit{Schistosoma haematobium} on its molluscan host \textit{Biomphalaria truncatus}. Parasitic castration has been observed by protozoa, helminths, and arthropods parasites. Assume that host repro rate decreases linearly with p load. Thus the equation describing parasite population growth doesn't change, only that for the host. Derive criteria for existance of an equilibrium. If equilibrium exists, stability criteria is $\alpha > \beta k$ where $\alpha$ is the added host mort/parasite, $\beta$ is the decrease in host reprod. rate/parasite and $k$ is the negative binomial "clumping" parameter. "Equation (5) says that for a host pop. to be stably reg. by its parasites, it is necessary that the parasites' influence on host repro. be not too severe relativel to the parasite induced mortality (i.e. that $\beta$ be small relative to $\alpha$) and /or that the parasites be highly over dispersed ($k$ small)." However, if $k$ is too small, not equil. exists. "parasite-induced dimnuation in host repro. (increased $\beta$) is destabilizing" while both overdispersion (small $k$) and density dep. parasite mort. (whether do to reg. within the host or via host mortality itself) propotes stability. Figures 3 and 4 are good summaries of this. Model E: Within-host parasite repro. Give an example of a human protozoan parasite (Entamoeba hystolytica) which reporduces within the host's gut and produces transmission stages. Model now includes a within-host repro. rate $r$. Find three possible outcomes: (1) Host pop. cannot be regulated, (2) Host population is regulated and the equilbrium is always stable (as long as $0\leq k < \infty$) and (3) parasite drives host population, and itself, extinct. "Too large a value of $r$ produces extinction; too small a value of $r$ can (derpending on the other parameter values) lead to unregulated host population growth." Adding density dep. parasite mort (e.g. immune response) increases the range of stable regulation. Note: from a broader perspective, when comparing model behavior and natural systems we are really only interested in whether or not the system should persist (i.e. not evolve to extinction), the question of regulation is secondary. Model F: Time delay b/w prod. of transmission stage and its maturation to being able to infect a host. First form is to just incorp. a time delay $T$, second form is to explicitly model infective stages. Found time delays can have a destabilizing effect. Conclusion: Cite Park (1948) and Lancinani (1975) as examples where parasites have been shown to affect host population growth rates. Also cite a study by Anderson, Whitfield, and Mills (1977) }

There's a unshown phase plane analysis and the come up with three scenarios. (a) the host pop. is reg. by the disease and the mean p burden per host is $r/ \alpha$, (b) host pop is unregulated, but parasite persists, and reduces its overall growth rate, and (c) the p. birth rate is so small that the p. cannot become est. even at infinite pop densities ($N_T$ is apparently negative b/c per parasite infect. stage prod. rate,$\lambda$ is less than rate at which infect. hosts are lost, $(\mu + b + \alpha)$. in some sense $\beta$ in part I is equivalent to $\lambda$ in part two. Mention effective net reproductive rate, but don't use term $R_0$. Indirect Lifecycles: Double the number of ODE's to describe the system. Ignoring immunity or making special assumpt. about "super infect" the system consists of four ODEs and is simliar to some classic epidemiological models: Ross-MacDonald for malaria, Nasell-Hirsch for schistosomiasis, and Dietz for arbovirus. They note, however, in these models and their great number of expansions and refinements that the terminal and intermed. host densities have previously been assumed to be constant. Since there are two hosts, apparently there is a combined threshold for both hosts. They then talk about making the system more complex by explicitly modelling trans stages as the did in the first macro model presented and how they can be reduced if the time scale of certain processes are very short relative to others (again paralleling the first part) so that you assume these short time scale events rapidly reach their eq. values. Discussions of malaria and shistosomiasis. Discuss evolutionary trends. One is how "the regulatory potential of an infectious disease will, therefore, typiclly change as time goes by." This is because the pathogen may be evolving to a more benign state and the host may be reducing its susceptiblity. Cite a number of studies where "increased pathogenicity may often be associated with enhanced rates of production (within a host) of the parasite's transmission stages" (citation numbers 38, 42, 43). Talk about general expected trends such as how host's with low densities should select for parasites which have indirect transmission where the trans. efficiency is very high (e.g. from prey to predator) or how pathogenicity and prevalence in the host should be inversely related. }

Looking at maximization of host geometric fitness and comparing that of a sexual host with an asex host. May and Anderson get rid of an asymmetry in the model (not clear on that one) and incorp. host density effects. Then replace Hamilton's phenomenological freq. dep. fitness function with the mechanistic gene for gene models they derive earlier in the paper. Their model appears is "asymptotically similar" to Hamiltons if you assume no host recovery from the infection. M\&A find the range at which sexual host does better than asex is severely reduced i.e. vanishes when compared with Hamilton if infection is not completely lethal (even if 99.9PERCENT lethal). (b) they now add density dependence to these models. The asex always wins, even with 100PERCENT lethal infections. (c) Expand model to include two loci Again comparing to results from Hamilton 1980 and again "these two locus systems have frequency dependence, but no density dependence" Results are similar to those in (a) where only get Hamilton's results if disease is 100PERCENT lethal.

Here we explore the evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite associations in which individual hosts can be coinfected with many different parasite strains. (We take coinfection to mean that each strain transmits at a rate unaffected by the presence of others in the same host.) This study thus represents the opposite extreme to our earlier work on superinfection in which there is a dominance hierarchy such that only the most virulent strain present in a host is transmitted. For highly diverse populations of parasite strains, we find that such coinfection leads to selection for strains whose virulence-levels lie in a relatively narrowband close to the maximum consistent with the parasite's basic preproductive ratio, R(0), exceeding unity. }

Evergreen woodland containing Pinus monophylla (singleleaf pinyon), Juniperus osteosperma (Utah juniper), and Quercus turbinella (shrub live oak) occupied the site during full glacial times. The latter two species, but not P. monophylla, persisted into the early Holocene and were joined by a limited number of desertscrub species, including Acacia greggii (catclaw), Carnegiea gigantea (saguaro), and several other succulents. With the arrival of many other species during the middle Holocene, a desertscrub community that differed considerably from the modem vegetation developed. Acacia greggii and Cercidium floridum (blue paloverde) were the principal large woody species on exposed hillslopes. Assemblages similar in composition to the modem desertscrub did not appear until approximately 4000 years ago, when the more xerophytic Cercidium microphyllum (foothills paloverde) arrived and C. floridum disappeared from hillslopes. The delayed arrival of C. microphyllum in comparison to other Sonoran Desertscrub species with similar climatic tolerances is attributed to the Limited dispersal distance of its seeds by seed-eating heteromyid rodents. At 4540 and 6425 yr B.P., the cold-intolerant shrub Encelia farinosa was present on northeasterly aspect exposures where it is absent today, suggesting slightly warmer winter conditions during the middle Holocene. The presence of the tree Cercidium floridum and the perennial, C-4 grass Setaria leucopila on exposed slopes during the middle Holocene indicates substantially moister conditions during that time than in the late Holocene or today. At sites on the xeric Limits of the modern distributions of both species, average annual precipitation is from 50\% to 100\% greater than that presently received at Eagle Eye Mountain. In particular, the responses of S. leucopila and cacti during the middle Holocene indicate substantial increases in warm-season precipitation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract                 = {Studies on the genetics of adaptation from new mutations typically neglect the possibility that a deleterious mutation might fix. Nonetheless, here we show that, in many regimes, the first mutation to fix is most often deleterious, even when fitness is expected to increase in the long term. In particular, we prove that this phenomenon occurs under weak mutation for any house-of-cards model with an equilibrium distribution. We find that the same qualitative results hold under Fisher's geometric model. We also provide a simple intuition for the surprising prevalence of unconditionally deleterious substitutions during early adaptation. Importantly, the phenomenon we describe occurs on fitness landscapes without any local maxima and is therefore distinct from valley crossing. Our results imply that the common practice of ignoring deleterious substitutions leads to qualitatively incorrect predictions in many regimes. Our results also have implications for the substitution process at equilibrium and for the response to a sudden decrease in population size.},

  Abstract                 = {The formula for the probability of fixation of a new mutation is widely used in theoretical population genetics and molecular evolution. Here we derive a series of identities, inequalities and approximations for the exact probability of fixation of a new mutation under the Moran process (equivalent results hold for the approximate probability of fixation under the Wright-Fisher process, after an appropriate change of variables). We show that the logarithm of the fixation probability has particularly simple behavior when the selection coefficient is measured as a difference of Malthusian fitnesses, and we exploit this simplicity to derive inequalities and approximations. We also present a comprehensive comparison of both existing and new approximations for the fixation probability, highlighting those approximations that induce a reversible Markov chain when used to describe the dynamics of evolution under weak mutation. To demonstrate the power of these results, we consider the classical problem of determining the total substitution rate across an ensemble of biallelic loci and prove that, at equilibrium, a strict majority of substitutions are due to drift rather than selection.

  Abstract                 = {PROTEINS often differ in amino-acid sequence across species. This difference has evolved by the accumulation of neutral mutations by random drift, the fixation of adaptive mutations by selection, or a mixture of the two. Here we propose a simple statistical test of the neutral protein evolution hypothesis based on a comparison of the number of amino-acid replacement substitutions to synonymous substitutions in the coding region of a locus. If the observed substitutions are neutral, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed differences between species should be the same as the ratio of replacement to synonymous polymorphisms within species. DNA sequence data on the Adh locus (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.1) in three species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup do not fit this expectation; instead, there are more fixed replacement differences between species than expected. We suggest that these excess replacement substitutions result from adaptive fixation of selectively advantageous mutations.}

  Abstract                 = {Height is correlated with risk to certain diseases and various socio-economic outcomes. As an easy to observe and measure trait, it has been a classic paradigm in the emergence of fundamental concepts regarding inheritance and genetics. Resemblances in height between relatives suggest that 80% of height variation is under genetic control with the rest controlled by environmental factors such as diet and disease exposure. Nearly a century ago it was recognised that many genes were likely to be involved but it is only with recent advances in technology that it has become possible to comprehensively search the human genome for DNA variants that control height. About 50 genes and regions of the genome have been associated with height to date. These begin to explain the biological basis of height, its links to disease and aid our understanding of the evolution of human height. The genes discovered so far have a very small individual effect and hundreds, maybe thousands, more of even smaller effects are still lost in the genome. Despite a successful start to height gene mapping, there remain considerable theoretical, technological, and statistical hurdles to be overcome in order to unravel its full genetic basis.},

There are no obvious or conserved DNA sequence motif determinants for centromere function, but the complex centromeres found in the majority of eukaryotes studied to date consist of repetitive DNA sequences. A striking feature of these repeats is that they maintain a high level of inter-repeat sequence identity within the centromere. This observation is suggestive of a recombination mechanism that operates at centromeres. Here we postulate that inter-repeat homologous recombination plays an intrinsic role in centromere function by forming covalently closed DNA loops. Moreover, the model provides an explanation of why both inverted and direct repeats are maintained and how they contribute to centromere function. },

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative genetics provides a powerful framework for studying phenotypic evolution and the evolution of adaptive genetic variation. Central to the approach is G, the matrix of additive genetic variances and covariances. G summarizes the genetic basis of the traits and can be used to predict the phenotypic response to multivariate selection or to drift. Recent analytical and computational advances have improved both the power and the accessibility of the necessary multivariate statistics. It is now possible to study the relationships between G and other evolutionary parameters, such as those describing the mutational input, the shape and orientation of the adaptive landscape, and the phenotypic divergence among populations. At the same time, we are moving towards a greater understanding of how the genetic variation summarized by G evolves. Computer simulations of the evolution of G, innovations in matrix comparison methods, and rapid development of powerful molecular genetic tools have all opened the way for dissecting the interaction between allelic variation and evolutionary process. Here I discuss some current uses of G, problems with the application of these approaches, and identify avenues for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Synonymous codon usage is a commonly used means for estimating gene expression levels of \emph{Escherichia coli} genes and has also been used for predicting highly expressed genes for a number of prokaryotic genomes. By comparison of expression level-dependent features in codon usage with protein abundance data from two proteome studies of exponentially growing E. coli and Bacillus subtilis cells, we try to evaluate whether the implicit assumption of this approach can be confirmed with experimental data. Log-odds ratio scores are used to model differences in codon usage between highly expressed genes and genomic average. Using these, the strength and significance of expression level-dependent features in codon usage were determined for the genes of the \emph{Escherichia coli}, Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae genomes. The comparison of codon usage features with protein abundance data confirmed a relationship between these to be present, although exceptions to this, possibly related to functional context, were found. For species with expression level-dependent features in their codon usage, the applied methodology could be used to improve in silico simulations of the outcome of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic experiments. }

However, new data suggest that the initial act of translation on newly synthesised {mRNA} also functions to proofread {mRNA} for errors. Aberrant {mRNA}s detected in this way are rapidly degraded before their encoded proteins impede normal cell function. Initiation of surveillance translation appears to differ from that of regular protein synthesis in three ways: (i) composition of the substrate; (ii) temporal and spatial restrictions; (iii) factors used to recruit the ribosome. This review discusses translational aspects of {mRNA} surveillance, primarily in the context of the mammalian system, although much information has come from studies in yeast and other organisms. },

  Abstract                 = {In Escherichia coli, CGG is a rare arginine codon occurring at a frequency of 0.54\% in all E coli mRNAs or 9.8\% when an arginine residue is encoded for. When present in high numbers or in clusters in highly expressed recombinant mRNA, rare codons can cause expression problems compromising product yield and translational fidelity. The coding region for an N-terminally polyhistidine tagged p27 protease domain from Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) contains 11 of these rare arginine codons, with 3 occurring in tandem near the C-terminus of the protein. When expressed in E coli, the majority of the recombinant material produced had an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa by SDS-PAGE gels or 3 kDa higher than predicted. Detailed biochemical analysis was performed on chemical and enzymatic digests of the protein and peptide fragments were characterized by Edman and MS/MS sequencing approaches. Two major species were isolated comprising +1 frameshift events at both the second and third CGG codons in the triplet cluster. Translation proceeded in the missense frame to the next termination codon. In addition, significant levels of glutamine misincorporating for arginine were discovered, suggesting second base misreading of CGG as CAG. Coexpression of the argX gene, which encodes the cognate tRNA for CGG codons, largely eliminated both the frameshift and misincorporation events, and increased expression levels of authentic product by up to 7-fold. We conclude that supplementation of the rare arginyl tRNACGG levels by coexpression of the argX gene can largely alleviate the CGG codon bias present in E coli, allowing for efficient and accurate translation of heterologous gene products.

We elaborate on previous population genetic models of codon usage to incorporate parameters of population polymorphism, and demonstrate that the degree of codon bias expected in a single sequence picked at random from the population is accurately predicted by previous models, irrespective of population polymorphism. This new model is used to explore the relationships between synonymous codon usage, nucleotide site diversity and the rate of substitution. We derive the equilibrium frequency distribution of weakly selected segregating sites under the infinite-sites model, and the expected nucleotide site diversity. Contrary to intuition, levels of silent-site diversity can increase with the strength of selection acting on codon usage. We also predict the effects of background selection on statistics of synonymous codon usage and derive simple formulae to predict patterns of codon usage at amino acids with more than two synonymous codons, and the effects of variation in selection coefficient between sites within a gene. We show that patterns of silent-site variation and synonymous codon usage on the X chromosome and autosomes in Drosophila are compatible with recessivity of the fitness effects of unpreferred codons. Finally, we suggest that there still exist considerable discrepancies between current models and data.},

  Abstract                 = {Selection acting on codon usage can cause patterns of synonymous evolution to deviate considerably from those expected under neutrality. To investigate the quantitative relationship between parameters of mutation, selection, and demography, and patterns of synonymous site divergence, we have developed a novel combination of population genetic models and likelihood methods of phylogenetic sequence analysis. Comparing 50 orthologous gene pairs from Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis and 27 from D. melanogaster and D. simulans, we show considerable variation between amino acids and genes in the strength of selection acting on codon usage and. find evidence for both long-term and short-term changes in the strength of selection between species. Remarkably, D. melanogaster shows no evidence of current selection on codon usage, while its sister species D. simulans experiences only half the selection pressure for codon usage of their common ancestor. We also find evidence for considerable base asymmetries in the rate of mutation, such that the average synonymous mutation rate is 20-30\% higher than in noncoding regions. A Bayesian approach is adopted to investigate how accounting for selection on codon usage influences estimates of tho parameters of mutation. },

  Abstract                 = {How to scale up from local-scale interactions to regional-scale dynamics is a critical issue in field ecology. We show how to implement a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up, using scale transition theory. Scale transition theory shows that dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from predictions based on the local dynamics alone because of an interaction between local-scale nonlinear dynamics and spatial variation in density or the environment. Based on this theory, a systematic approach to scaling up has four steps: (1) derive a model to translate the effects of local dynamics to the regional scale, and to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation, (2) measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales, (3) measure spatial variation, and (4) combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. We illustrate the approach, with an example from benthic stream ecology of caddisflies living in riffles. By sampling from a simulated system, we show how collecting the appropriate data at local (riffle) scales to measure nonlinearities, combined with measures of spatial variation, leads to the correct inference for dynamics at the larger scale of the stream. The approach provides a way to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of changes in population dynamics with spatial scale using a relatively small amount of field data. }

The fate of a resistance mutation in pathogen populations is determined in part by its fitness. Mutations that suffer little or no fitness cost are more likely to persist in the absence of antibiotic treatment. In this review, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the fitness costs associated with single mutational events that confer resistance. Generally, these mutations were costly, although several drug classes and species of bacteria on average did not show a cost. Further investigations into the rate and fitness values of compensatory mutations that alleviate the costs of resistance will help us to better understand both the emergence and management of antibiotic resistance in clinical settings.},

This is particularly important for a large class of moral norms relating to rapidly changing technological or social environments, such as norms regarding the acceptability of genetically modified organisms. Here we suggest that a science of morality/ethics can benefit from adopting a cultural evolution or gene-culture coevolution approach, which treats culture as a second, separate evolutionary system that acts in parallel to biological/genetic evolution. This cultural evolution approach brings with it a set of established theoretical concepts (e.g. different cultural transmission mechanisms) and empirical methods (e.g. evolutionary game theory) that can significantly improve our understanding of human morality.},

Logistic regression was used to distinguish the shape of the functional response (type II or III), and nonlinear least-squares regression was used to estimate attack coefficients (a) and handling times (TI,). In dishes, the behavior of both beetle larvae and adults closely conformed to a type II response. Estimates of a and T-h on whole plants were considerably different from those obtained from dishes, and they also depended on plant species. Beetle adults consumed more aphids on the slender-leaved Indian ricegrass, Oryzopsis hymenoides (Roemer \& Schultes) Ricker, than on the broad-leaved crested wheatgrass, Agropyron desertorum (Fisher ex Link) Schultes, at each aphid density. Moreover, logistic regression suggested a type II response on Indian ricegrass versus a type III (sigmoidal) response on crested wheatgrass. The complex response on crested wheatgrass may have been caused by density-dependent changes in the proportion of aphids in refuges (such as rolled leaves). By modifying the shapes and parameters of functional responses, plant traits can influence the stability of predator-prey dynamics and the success of biological control.}

Our method combines the traditional Goldman-Yang model of coding-sequence evolution with the information obtained from the 3D structure of the evolving protein, specifically the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of individual residues. We develop a random-effects likelihood sites model in which rate classes are RSA dependent. The RSA dependence is modeled with linear functions. We demonstrate that our RSA-dependent model provides a significantly better fit to molecular sequence data than does a traditional, RSA-independent model. We further show that our model provides a natural, RSA-dependent neutral baseline for the evolutionary rate ratio omega = dN/dS Sites that deviate from this neutral baseline likely experience selection pressure for function. We apply our method to the influenza proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. For hemagglutinin, our method recovers positively selected sites near the sialic acid-binding site and negatively selected sites that may be important for trimerization. For neuraminidase, our method recovers the oseltamivir resistance site and otherwise suggests that few sites deviate from the neutral baseline. Our method is broadly applicable to any protein sequences for which structural data are available or can be obtained via homology modeling or threading.},

  Abstract                 = {In multicellular organisms, cells cooperate within a well-defined developmental program. Cancer is a breakdown of such cooperation: cells mutate to phenotypes of uncoordinated proliferation. We study basic principles of the architecture of solid tissues that influence the rate of cancer initiation. In particular, we explore how somatic selection acts to prevent or to promote cancer. Cells with mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes often have increased proliferation rates. Somatic selection increases their abundance and thus enhances the risk of cancer. Many potentially harmful mutations, however, increase the probability of triggering apoptosis and, hence, initially lead to cells with reduced net proliferation rates. Such cells are eliminated by somatic selection, which therefore also works to reduce the risk of cancer. We show that a tissue organization into small compartments avoids the rapid spread of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, but promotes genetic instability. In small compartments, genetic instability, which confers a selective disadvantage for the cell, can spread by random drift. If both deleterious and advantageous mutations participate in tumor initiation, then we find an intermediate optimum for the compartment size.},

Recently there has been considerable interest in linking withinand between-host levels of disease dynamics in the study of pathogen evolution. Here we review the extent to which these nested models have increased our understanding of pathogen evolution. We suggest that, although such models have been useful for determining the nature of tradeoffs between epidemiological parameters and for evaluating the consequences of conflicting selection pressures at different scales, the vast majority of previous results could likely have been obtained without the use of nested models per se. Nevertheless, these models have proven very useful through their highlighting of the importance of within-host disease dynamics on pathogen evolution. },

  Abstract                 = {Summary: High-affinity iron acquisition is mediated by siderophore-dependent pathways in the majority of pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria and fungi. Considerable progress has been made in characterizing and understanding mechanisms of siderophore synthesis, secretion, iron scavenging, and siderophore-delivered iron uptake and its release. The regulation of siderophore pathways reveals multilayer networks at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Due to the key role of many siderophores during virulence, coevolution led to sophisticated strategies of siderophore neutralization by mammals and (re)utilization by bacterial pathogens. Surprisingly, hosts also developed essential siderophore-based iron delivery and cell conversion pathways, which are of interest for diagnostic and therapeutic studies. In the last decades, natural and synthetic compounds have gained attention as potential therapeutics for iron-dependent treatment of infections and further diseases. Promising results for pathogen inhibition were obtained with various siderophore-antibiotic conjugates acting as "Trojan horse" toxins and siderophore pathway inhibitors. In this article, general aspects of siderophore-mediated iron acquisition, recent findings regarding iron-related pathogen-host interactions, and current strategies for iron-dependent pathogen control will be reviewed. Further concepts including the inhibition of novel siderophore pathway targets are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {It is often claimed that modern humans have stopped evolving because cultural and technological advancements have annihilated natural selection. In contrast, recent studies show that selection can be strong in contemporary populations. However, detecting a response to selection is particularly challenging; previous evidence from wild animals has been criticized for both applying anticonservative statistical tests and failing to consider random genetic drift. Here we study life-history variation in an insular preindustrial French-Canadian population and apply a recently proposed conservative approach to testing microevolutionary responses to selection. As reported for other such societies, natural selection favored an earlier age at first reproduction (AFR) among women. AFR was also highly heritable and genetically correlated to fitness, predicting a microevolutionary change toward earlier reproduction. In agreement with this prediction, AFR declined from about 26-22 y over a 140-y period. Crucially, we uncovered a substantial change in the breeding values for this trait, indicating that the change in AFR largely occurred at the genetic level. Moreover, the genetic trend was higher than expected under the effect of random genetic drift alone. Our results show that microevolution can be detectable over relatively few generations in humans and underscore the need for studies of human demography and reproductive ecology to consider the role of evolutionary processes.},

The ribosome speed is codon dependent, and ribosome queuing has been suggested to explain specific data for translation of some {mRNA}s \emph{in vivo}. By modeling the stochastic translation process as a traffic problem, we here analyze conditions and consequences of collisions and queuing. The model allowed us to determine the on-rate (0.8 to 1.1 mutations/s) and the time (1 s) the preceding ribosome occludes initiation for \emph{Escherichia coli} lacZ {mRNA} \emph{in vivo}. We find that ribosome collisions and queues are inevitable consequences of a stochastic translation mechanism that reduce the translation efficiency substantially on natural {mRNA}s. The cells minimize collisions by having its {mRNA}s being unstable and by a highly selected codon usage in the start of the {mRNA}. The cost of {mRNA} breakdown is offset by the concomitant increase in translation efficiency. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Codon usage has direct utility in molecular characterization of species and is also a marker for molecular evolution. To understand codon usage within the diverse phylum Nematoda, we analyzed a total of 265,494 expressed sequence tags ( ESTs) from 30 nematode species. The full genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae were also examined. A total of 25,871,325 codons were analyzed and a comprehensive codon usage table for all species was generated. This is the first codon usage table available for 24 of these organisms. Results: Codon usage similarity in Nematoda usually persists over the breadth of a genus but then rapidly diminishes even within each clade. Globodera, Meloidogyne, Pristionchus, and Strongyloides have the most highly derived patterns of codon usage. The major factor affecting differences in codon usage between species is the coding sequence GC content, which varies in nematodes from 32\% to 51\%. Coding GC content ( measured as GC3) also explains much of the observed variation in the effective number of codons (R = 0.70), which is a measure of codon bias, and it even accounts for differences in amino acid frequency. Codon usage is also affected by neighboring nucleotides (NI context). Coding GC content correlates strongly with estimated noncoding genomic GC content ( R = 0.92). On examining abundant clusters in five species, candidate optimal codons were identified that may be preferred in highly expressed transcripts. Conclusion: Evolutionary models indicate that total genomic GC content, probably the product of directional mutation pressure, drives codon usage rather than the converse, a conclusion that is supported by examination of nematode genomes. },

  Abstract                 = {Background: An ideal format to describe transcriptome would be its composition measured on the scale of absolute numbers of individual mRNAs per cell. It would help not only to precisely grasp the structure of the transcriptome but also to accelerate data exchange and integration. Results: We conceived an idea of competitive PCR between genomic DNA and cDNA. Since the former contains every gene exactly at the same copy number, it can serve as an ideal normalization standard for the latter to obtain stoichiometric composition data of the transcriptome. This data can then be easily converted to absolute quantification data provided with an appropriate calibration. To implement this idea, we improved adaptor-tagged competitive PCR, originally developed for relative quantification of the 3'-end restriction fragment of each cDNA, such that it can be applied to any restriction fragment. We demonstrated that this "generalized" adaptor-tagged competitive PCR (GATC-PCR) can be performed between genomic DNA and cDNA to accurately measure absolute expression level of each mRNA in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, we constructed a large-scale GATC-PCR system to measure absolute expression levels of 5,038 genes to show that the yeast contains more than 30,000 copies of mRNA molecules per cell. Conclusion: We developed a GATC-PCR method to accurately measure absolute expression levels of mRNAs by means of competitive amplification of genomic and cDNA copies of each gene. A large-scale application of GATC-PCR to the budding yeast transcriptome revealed that it is twice or more as large as previously estimated. This method is flexibly applicable to both targeted and genome-wide analyses of absolute expression levels of mRNAs. },

It can approximate a wide range of codon substitution processes. If no selection pressure on amino acids is taken into account, it will become equivalent to a nucleotide substitution model. If mutation rates are assumed not to depend on the codon type, then it will become essentially equivalent to an amino acid substitution model. Mutation at the nucleotide level and selection at the amino acid level can be separately evaluated.\\ Results:The present scheme for single nucleotide mutations is equivalent to the general time-reversible model, but multiple nucleotide changes in infinitesimal time are allowed. Selective constraints on the respective types of amino acid replacements are tailored to each gene in a linear function of a given estimate of selective constraints. Their good estimates are those calculated by maximizing the respective likelihoods of empirical amino acid or codon substitution frequency matrices. Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicate that the present model performs far better than the other substitution models for all five phylogenetic trees of highly-divergent to highly-homologous sequences of chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear genes. It is also shown that multiple nucleotide changes in infinitesimal time are significant in long branches, although they may be caused by compensatory substitutions or other mechanisms. The variation of selective constraint over sites fits the datasets significantly better than variable mutation rates, except for 10 slow-evolving nuclear genes of 10 mammals. An critical finding for phylogenetic analysis is that assuming variable mutation rates over sites lead to the overestimation of branch lengths.</p> </sec>},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Nucleotide and amino acid substitution tendencies are characteristic of each species, organelle, and protein family. Hence, various empirical amino acid substitution rate matrices have needed to be estimated for phylogenetic analysis: JTT, WAG, and LG for nuclear proteins, mtREV for mitochondrial proteins, cpREV10 and cpREV64 for chloroplast-encoded proteins, and FLU for influenza proteins. On the other hand, in a mechanistic codon substitution model, in which each codon substitution rate is proportional to the product of a codon mutation rate and the ratio of fixation depending on the type of amino acid replacement, mutation rates and the strength of selective constraint on amino acids can be tailored to each protein family with additional 11 parameters. As a result, in the evolutionary analysis of codon sequences it outperforms codon substitution models equivalent to empirical amino acid substitution matrices. Is it superior even for amino acid sequences, among which synonymous substitutions cannot be identified? Results: Nucleotide mutations are assumed to occur independently of codon positions but multiple nucleotide changes in infinitesimal time are allowed. Selective constraints on the respective types of amino acid replacements are tailored to each gene with a linear function of a given estimate of selective constraints, which were estimated by maximizing the likelihood of an empirical amino acid or codon substitution frequency matrix, each of JTT, WAG, LG, and KHG. It is shown that the mechanistic codon substitution model with the assumption of equal codon usage yields better values of Akaike and Bayesian information criteria for all three phylogenetic trees of mitochondrial, chloroplast, and influenza-A hemagglutinin proteins than the empirical amino acid substitution models with mtREV, cpREV64, and FLU, which were designed specifically for those protein families, respectively. The variation of selective constraint across sites fits the datasets significantly better than variable codon mutation rates, confirming that substitution rate variations across sites detected by amino acid substitution models are caused primarily by the variation of selective constraint against amino acid substitutions rather than the variation of codon mutation rate. Conclusions: The mechanistic codon substitution model is superior to amino acid substitution models even in the evolutionary analysis of protein sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {Uncontrolled protein aggregation is a constant challenge in all compartments of living organisms. The failure of a peptide or protein to remain soluble often results in pathology. So far, more than 40 human diseases have been associated with the formation of extracellular fibrillar aggregates - known as amyloid fibrils or structurally related intracellular deposits. It is well known that molecular chaperones and elaborate quality control mechanisms exist in the cell to counteract aggregation. However, an increasing number of reports during the past few years indicate that proteins have also evolved structural and sequence-based strategies to prevent aggregation. This review describes these strategies and the selection pressures that exist on protein sequences to combat their uncontrolled aggregation. We will describe the different types of mechanism evolved by proteins that adopt different conformational states including normally folded proteins, intrinsically disordered polypeptide chains, elastomeric systems and multimodular proteins. },

Gene duplicates account for 8-20\% of the genes in eukaryotic genomes, and the rates of gene duplication are estimated at between 0.2\% and 2\% per gene per million years. Duplicate genes are believed to be a major mechanism for the establishment of new gene functions and the generation of evolutionary novelty, yet very little is known about the early stages of the evolution of duplicated gene pairs. It is unclear, for example, to what extent selection, rather than neutral genetic drift, drives the fixation and early evolution of duplicate loci. Analysis of recently duplicated genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome reveals significantly reduced species-wide levels of nucleotide polymorphisms in the progenitor and/or duplicate gene copies, suggesting that selective sweeps accompany the initial stages of the evolution of these duplicated gene pairs. Our results support recent theoretical work that indicates that fates of duplicate gene pairs may be determined in the initial phases of duplicate gene evolution and that positive selection plays a prominent role in the evolutionary dynamics of the very early histories of duplicate nuclear genes. },

By combining recent advances in genomic analysis with a new conceptual framework, researchers are determining the contributions of single-gene and whole-genome duplications to the diversification of plant species.

  Abstract                 = {The default framework for modeling biochemical processes is that of a constant-volume reactor operating under steady-state conditions. This is satisfactory for many applications, but not for modeling growth and division of cells. In this study, a whole-cell modeling framework is developed that assumes expanding volumes and a cell-division cycle. A spherical newborn cell is designed to grow in volume during the growth phase of the cycle. After 80\% of the cycle period, the cell begins to divide by constricting about its equator, ultimately affording two spherical cells with total volume equal to twice that of the original. The cell is partitioned into two regions or volumes, namely the cytoplasm (V-cyt) and membrane (V-mem), with molecular components present in each. Both volumes change during the cell cycle; V-cyt changes in response to osmotic pressure changes as nutrients enter the cell from the environment, while V-mem changes in response to this osmotic pressure effect such that membrane thickness remains invariant. The two volumes change at different rates; in most cases, this imposes periodic or oscillatory behavior on all components within the cell. Since the framework itself rather than a particular set of reactions and components is responsible for this behavior, it should be possible to model various biochemical processes within it, affording stable periodic solutions without requiring that the biochemical process itself generates oscillations as an inherent feature. Given that these processes naturally occur in growing and dividing cells, it is reasonable to conclude that the dynamics of component concentrations will be more realistic than when modeled within constant-volume and/or steady-state frameworks. This approach is illustrated using a symbolic whole cell model. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We found that each amino acid contributes about equally and highly significantly to overall codon usage bias, with the exception of Asp which had very low contribution to overall bias. Asp was also the only amino acid that did not show a clear preference for one of its synonymous codons. Synonymous codon usage in Drosophila was consistent with ''optimal'' codons deduced from the isoaccepting {tRNA} availability. Interestingly, amino acids whose major isoaccepting {tRNA}s change during development did not show as strong bias as those with developmentally unchanged {tRNA} pools. Asp is the only amino acid for which the major isoaccepting {tRNA}s change between larval and adult stages.

The correlation was significantly positive in E.coli genes, whereas negative correlations were obtained for D.melanogaster and S.cerevisiae genes, When only ribosomal protein genes were used, whose expression levels are assumed to be similar, E.coli and S.cerevisiae showed significantly positive correlations. For the two eukaryotes, the distribution of effective number of codons was different in short genes (300-500 bp) compared with longer genes; this was not observed in E,coli. Both positive and negative correlations can be explained by translational selection. Energetically costly longer genes have higher codon usage bias to maximize translational efficiency. Selection may also be acting to reduce the size of highly expressed proteins, and the effect is particularly pronounced in eukaryotes. The different relationships between codon usage bias and gene length observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes may be the consequence of these different types of selection. },

As a result of these characteristics, a given SAGE sample may fail to capture a large number of expressed {mRNA} species present in the tissue. Empirical estimators of {mRNA} species' relative abundance effectively ignore these missing species, and as a result tend to overestimate the abundance of the scarce observed species comprising a vast majority of the total. We have developed a new Bayesian estimation procedure that quantifies our prior information about these characteristics, yielding a nonlinear shrinkage estimator with efficiency advantages over the MLE. Our prior is mixture of Dirichlets, whereby species are stochastically partitioned into abundant and scarce classes, each with its own multivariate prior. Simulation studies reveal our estimator has lower integrated mean squared error (IMSE) than the MLE for the SAGE scenarios simulated, and yields relative abundance profiles closer in Euclidean distance to the truth for all samples simulated. We apply our method to a SAGE library of normal colon tissue, and discuss its implications for assessing differential expression. },

  Abstract                 = {Models that explicitly account for the effect of selection on new mutations have been proposed to account for "codon bias" or the excess of "preferred" codons that results from selection for translational efficiency and/or accuracy. In principle, such models can be applied to any mutation that results in a preferred allele, but in most cases, the fitness effect of a specific mutation cannot be predicted. Here we show that it is possible to assign preferred and unpreferred states to amino acid changing mutations that occur in protein domains. We propose that mutations that lead to more common amino acids (at a given position in a domain) can be considered "preferred alleles" just as are synonymous mutations leading to codons for more abundant {tRNA}s. We use genome-scale polymorphism data to show that alleles for preferred amino acids in protein domains occur at higher frequencies in the population, as has been shown for preferred codons. We show that this effect is quantitative, such that there is a correlation between the shift in frequency of preferred alleles and the predicted fitness effect. As expected, we also observe a reduction in the numbers of polymorphisms and substitutions at more important positions in domains, consistent with stronger selection at those positions. We examine the derived allele frequency distribution and polymorphism to divergence ratios of preferred and unpreferred differences and find evidence for both negative and positive selections acting to maintain protein domains in the human population. Finally, we analyze a model for selection on amino acid preferences in protein domains and find that it is consistent with the quantitative effects that we observe.},

Here we describe a new mutation in MSTN found in the whippet dog breed that results in a double-muscled phenotype known as the "bully" whippet. Individuals with this phenotype carry two copies of a two-base-pair deletion in the third exon of MSTN leading to a premature stop codon at amino acid 313. Individuals carrying only one copy of the mutation are, on average, more muscular than wild-type individuals (p = 7.43 x 10(-6); Kruskal-Wallis Test) and are significantly faster than individuals carrying the wild-type genotype in competitive racing events (Kendall's nonparametric measure, tau = 0.3619; p approximately 0.00028). These results highlight the utility of performance-enhancing polymorphisms, marking the first time a mutation in MSTN has been quantitatively linked to increased athletic performance.},

We first try to define, for each species, the neutral expected codon usage to better approach subsequently the influence of selection. Overlapping triplets counted from the complete DNA genomic sequence and mean amino acid composition of ORFs allow us to build satisfying expected codon usage for each species. Within species deviation from this neutral model is then studied through Correspondence Analysis and characterization with bias index, N-C' (effective number of codons reported to neutral model). Our results are compared to previously published ones for three species and let appear good agreement in spite of very different methods. We thus propose set of codons probably preferred by selection for nine other species. In the four last species, no clear preference can be evidenced. Finally, we characterize variation of codon usage over functional categories. We propose that the high degree of bias of proteins involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis has a positive influence on overexpression of the corresponding genes under optimum growth conditions and is a negative regulator of the same genes when amino acids become limited resources.}

In order to identify general rules that shape codon-pair context and minimize mRNA decoding error, we have carried out a large scale comparative codon-pair context analysis of 119 fully sequenced genomes. Methodologies/Principal Findings. We have developed mathematical and software tools for large scale comparative codon-pair context analysis. These methodologies unveiled general and species specific codon-pair context rules that govern evolution of mRNAs in the 3 domains of life. We show that evolution of bacterial and archeal mRNA primary structure is mainly dependent on constraints imposed by the translational machinery, while in eukaryotes DNA methylation and tri-nucleotide repeats impose strong biases on codon-pair context. Conclusions. The data highlight fundamental differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic mRNA decoding rules, which are partially independent of codon usage. },

Strand compositional asymmetry is not observed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. genome nor in the archaeal genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. A strong strand compositional asymmetry is observed in beta-type but not alphaor gamma-type human herpesviruses featuring G > C downstream of oriL and C > G upstream of oriL. Dinucleotide relative abundances (i.e., dinucleotide representations normalized by the component nucleotide frequencies) are consonant with respect to the leading and lagging strands. Strand compositional asymmetry may reflect on differences in replication synthesis of the leading versus lagging strand, on differences between template and coding strand associated with transcription-coupled repair mechanisms, on differences in gene density between the two strands, on differences in residue and codon biases in relation to gene function, expression level, or operon organization, or on differences in single as context dependent base mutational rates. The absence of strand asymmetry in the archaeal genomes may reflect the presence of multiple origins of replication. }

Highly expressed genes of the Synechocystis genome feature several photosystem II genes, and highly expressed genes in several methanogens (Methanococcus jannaschii, nl. thermoautotrophicum) are essential for methanogenesis, Alien genes mostly consist of ORFs of unknown function, transposases, prophage genes, and restriction/modification enzymes, Notably, nuclear ribosomal proteins of yeast are highly expressed, whereas mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes appear to be alien genes.

The detection of mimivirus and other large viruses has stimulated new analysis and discussion concerning the early evolution of life and the complexity and mechanisms of evolutionary transitions. This paper presents analysis in three contexts. (t) Genome signatures of large viruses tend to deviate from the genome signatures of their hosts, perhaps indicating that the large viruses are lytic in the hosts. (h) Proteome composition within these viral genomes contrast with cellular organisms; for example, most eukaryotic genomes, with respect to acidic residue usages, select Glu overAsp, but the opposite generally prevails for the large viral genomes preferring Asp more than Glu. In comparing Phe vs. Tyr usage, the viral genomes select mostly Tyr over Phe, whereas in almost all bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, Phe is used more than Tyr. Interpretations of these contrasts are proffered with respect to protein structure and function. (iii) Frequent oligonucleoticles and pepticles are characterized in the large viral genomes. The frequent words may provide structural flexibility to interact with host proteins. }

Predicted highly expressed genes often reflect the organism's predominant lifestyle, habitat, nutrition sources and metabolic propensities. This technique allows to predict principal metabolic activities of the microorganisms operating in their natural habitats. Among our findings is an unusually high number of PHX enzymes acting in cell wall biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis and replication in the ant endosymbiont Blochmannia floridanus. We ascribe the abundance of these PHX genes to specific aspects of the relationship between the bacterium and its host. Xanthomonas campestris is unique with a very high number of PHX genes acting in flagellum biosynthesis, which may play a special role during its pathogenicity. Shewanella oneidensis possesses three protein complexes which all can function as complex I in the respiratory chain but only the Na+-transporting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase nqr-2 operon is PHX. The PHX genes of Vibrio parahaemolyticus are consistent with the microorganism's adaptation to extremely fast growth rates. Comparative analysis of PHX genes from complex environmental genomic sequences as well as from uncultured pathogenic microbes can provide a novel, useful tool to predict global flux of matter and key intermediates.}

  Abstract                 = {Intra-genomic variation between housekeeping and tissue-specific genes has always been a study of interest in higher eukaryotes. To-date, however, no such investigation has been done in plants. Availability of whole genome expression data for both rice and Arabidopsis has made it possible to examine the evolutionary forces in shaping codon usage pattern in both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in plants. In the present work, we have taken 4065 rice-Arabidopsis homologous gene pairs to study evolutionary forces responsible for codon usage divergence between housekeeping and tissue-specific genes. In both rice and Arabidopsis, it is mutational bias that regulates error minimization in highly expressed genes of both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes. Our results show that, in comparison to tissue-specific genes, housekeeping genes are under strong selective constraint in plants. However, in tissue-specific genes, lowly expressed genes are under stronger selective constraint compared with highly expressed genes. We demonstrated that constraint acting on {mRNA} secondary structure is responsible for modulating codon usage variations in rice tissue-specific genes. Thus, different evolutionary forces must underline the evolution of synonymous codon usage of highly expressed genes of housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in rice and Arabidopsis. },

  Abstract                 = {Surprisingly little is known about the physical environment inside a prokaryotic cell. Knowledge of the rates at which proteins and other cell components can diffuse is crucial for the understanding of a cell as a physical system. There have been numerous measurements of diffusion coefficients in eukaryotic cells by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and related techniques. Much less information is available about diffusion coefficients in prokaryotic cells, which differ from eukaryotic cells in a number of significant respects. We have used FRAP to observe the diffusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in cells of Escherichia coli elongated by growth in the presence of cephalexin. GFP was expressed in the cytoplasm, exported into the periplasm using the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system, or fused to an integral plasma membrane protein (TatA). We show that TatA-GFP diffuses in the plasma membrane with a diffusion coefficient comparable to that of a typical eukaryotic membrane protein. A previous report showed a very low rate of protein diffusion in the E. coli periplasm. However, we measured a GFP diffusion coefficient only slightly smaller in the periplasm than that in the cytoplasm, showing that both cell compartments are relatively fluid environments. },

  Abstract                 = {Background: Various methods for estimating protein expression levels are known. The level of correlation between these methods is only fair, and systematic biases in each of the methods cannot be ruled out. We here investigate systematic biases in the estimation of gene expression rates from microarray data and from abundance within the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database. We suggest that length is a significant factor in biases to measured gene expression rates. As a specific example of the importance of the bias of expression rate with length, we address the following evolutionary question: Does the average C. elegans protein length increase or decrease with expression level? Two different answers to this question have been reported in the literature, one method using expression levels estimated by abundance within the EST database and another using microarrays. We have investigated this issue by constructing the full protein length versus expression curve for C. elegans, using both methods for estimating expression levels. Results: The microarray data show a monotonic decrease of length with expression level, whereas the abundance within the EST database data show a non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, the ratio of the expression level estimated by the EST database to that measured by microarrays is not constant, but rather systematically biased with gene length. Conclusions: It is suggested that the length bias may lie primarily in the abundance within the EST database method, being not ameliorated by internal standards as it is in the microarray data, and that this bias should be removed before data interpretation. When this is done, both the microarray and the abundance within the EST database give a monotonic decrease of spliced length with expression level, and the correlation between the EST and microarray data becomes larger. We suggest that standard RNA controls be used to normalize for length bias in any method that measures expression. },

Blood biochemical and haematological analyses were performed weekly and faecal worm egg counts bi-weekly. Complete parasitological examinations were performed on all ponies at various times post-initial infection (PI): one infected animal at 9 weeks PI, four animals (three infected, one control) at 20 weeks PI and four animals (two infected, two controls) at 60-62 weeks PI, All ponies in the infected groups experienced a marked reduction in weight gain and two animals developed clinical disease: one pony developed intermittent diarrhoea and colic 8 weeks PI; another pony developed intermittent diarrhoea between 30 and 52 weeks PI. All infected ponies had decreased serum fructosamine concentrations and five had decreased serum albumin, which were first apparent 4-6 weeks PI, Alterations in the composition of serum globulins were detected in all ponies. Transient neutrophilia was observed in five animals from the infected groups 3-9 weeks PI. Serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations were increased in one pony between 30 and 60 weeks PI, During the course of the experiment, faecal samples from all infected animals were negative for worm eggs. At necropsy, cyathostome larvae were present within the mucosa of the large intestine of all infected ponies, however the mucosal larval counts varied considerably between individuals. }

  Abstract                 = {1. We studied the effect of parasitism on snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) survival through a field experiment that reduced natural burdens of sublethal nematodes in a free-ranging hare population. We treated half the hares on each of six study areas year-round with an anthelminthic drug, and the other half with a placebo. Potential interactive effects of parasitism and nutrition were examined by supplementing the natural food supply on three of the six study areas during two winters. Survival was measured by radio-collaring a total of 612 hares with mortality-sensitive transmitters and monitoring survival daily between April 1991 and June 1993. 2. Overall, nematode burdens in hares were highest between March and October, and Obeliscoides cuniculi was the most abundant of the five species present. The proximate cause of 95PERCENT of mortalities (n = 318) during the study was predation. Predators killed hares with heavy burdens of O. cuniculi disporportionately during May-June, but burdens of the four other species (Nematodirus triangularis, Trichuris leporis, Dirofilaria scapiceps, Protostrongylus boughtoni) were similar between predator-killed hares and the live population. 3. During May-October 1991, the anthelminthic treatment did not affect hare survival, but during May-October 1992 survival of parasite-reduced hares was 2.4-times higher than that of controls. During November 1991-April 1992 survival of food supplemented hares was 21PERCENT higher than food-normal animals, but survival was similar during November 1992-April 1993. 4. The effect of parasite-reduction on hare survival was apparently contingent on overwinter food supplies between November 1991 and April 1992, with survival being highest in hares subjected to both treatments, intermediate in those receiving only food supplementation, and lowest in unfed hares. We conclude that the effect of sublethal nematode parasitism on hare survival can be important if interactive with predation, and that synergistic effects of parasitism and nutrition may affect hares if food availability is limited. }

  Abstract                 = {A model of DNA sequence evolution applicable to coding regions is presented. This represents the first evolutionary model that accounts for dependencies among nucleotides within a codon. The model uses the codon, as opposed to the nucleotide, as the unit of evolution, and is parameterized in terms of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rates. One of the model's advantages over those used in methods for estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates is that it completely corrects for multiple hits at a codon, rather than taking a parsimony approach and considering only pathways of minimum change between homologous codons. Likelihood-ratio versions of the relative-rate test are constructed and applied to data from the complete chloroplast DNA sequences of Oryza sativa, Nicotiana tabacum, and Marchantia polymorpha. Results of these tests confirm previous findings that substitution rates in the chloroplast genome are subject to both lineage-specific and locus-specific effects. Additionally, the new tests suggest tha the rate heterogeneity is due primarily to differences in nonsynonymous substitution rates. Simulations help confirm previous suggestions that silent sites are saturated, leaving no evidence of heterogeneity in synonymous substitution rates. },

These prokaryotes are characterized by a strong mutational bias towards A+T, a striking excess of coding sequences and purine-rich leading strands of replication, strong GC-skews and a high frequency of genomic rearrangements. As expected, it was found that the mutational bias dominates codon usage but there is some variation of synonymous codon choices among genes in the two species. This variation was investigated using a multivariate statistical approach. In the two species, two major trends were detected. One was related to the location of the sequences in the leading or lagging strand of replication, and the other was associated with the preferential use of putatively translational optimal codons in heavily expressed genes. Analyses of the estimated number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions among orthologous genes permit us to postulate that optimal codons might be selected not only for speed but also for accuracy during translation. }

When all genes are considered, codon usage is strongly biased toward A and T in third codon positions, as expected, but multivariate statistical analysis detects a major trend among genes. At one end genes display codon choices determined mainly by the extreme genome composition of this parasite, and very probably their expression level is low. At the other end a few genes exhibit an increased relative usage of a particular subset of codons, many of which are C-ending. Since the majority of these few genes is putatively highly expressed, we postulate that the increased C-ending codons are translationally optimal. In conclusion, while codon usage of the majority of P. falciparum genes is determined mainly by compositional constraints, a small number of genes exhibit translational selection.}

We find evidence that selection itself is strongly time-dependent, with changes occurring at nearly the rate of neutral evolution. At the same time, higher than previously estimated levels of selection make adaptive responses by a factor 10-100 faster than the pace of selection changes, ensuring that adaptations are an efficient mode of evolution under time-dependent selection. The rate of selection changes is faster in noncoding DNA, i.e., the inference of functional elements can less be based on sequence conservation than for proteins. Our results suggest that selection acts not only as a constraint but as a major driving force of genomic change.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of untranslated regions, introns, and coding regions within an organism remains challenging. We developed a quantitative sequencingbased method called RNA- Seq for mapping transcribed regions, in which complementary DNA fragments are subjected to high- throughput sequencing and mapped to the genome. We applied RNA- Seq to generate a high- resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most ( 74.5\%) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3'- end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.},

  Abstract                 = {When selection is strong and beneficial alleles have a single origin, local reductions in genetic diversity are expected. However, when beneficial alleles have multiple origins or were segregating in the population prior to a change in selection regime, the impact on genetic diversity may be less clear. We describe an example of such a "soft" selective sweep in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum that involves adaptive genome rearrangements. Amplification in copy number of genome regions containing the pfmdr1 gene on chromosome 5 confer resistance to mefloquine and spread rapidly in the 1990s. Using flanking microsatellite data and real-time polymerase chain reaction determination of copy number, we show that 5-15 independent amplification events have occurred in parasites on the Thailand/Burma border. The amplified genome regions (amplicons) range in size from 14.7 to 49 kb and contain 2-11 genes, with 2-4 copies arranged in tandem. To examine the impact of drug selection on flanking variation, we genotyped 48 microsatellites on chromosome 5 in 326 parasites from a single Thai location. Diversity was reduced in a 170to 250-kb (10-15 cM) region of chromosomes containing multiple copies of pfmdr1, consistent with hitchhiking resulting from the rapid recent spread of selected chromosomes. However, diversity immediately flanking pfmdr1 is reduced by only 42\% on chromosomes bearing multiple amplicons relative to chromosomes carrying a single copy. We highlight 2 features of these results: 1) All amplicon break points occur in monomeric A/T tracts (9-45 bp). Given the abundance of these tracts in P. falciparum, we expect that duplications will occur frequently at multiple genomic locations and have been underestimated as drivers of phenotypic evolution in this pathogen. 2) The signature left by the spread of amplified genome segments is broad, but results in only limited reduction in diversity. If such "soft" sweeps are common in nature, statistical methods based on diversity reduction may be inefficient at detecting evidence for selection in genome-wide marker screens. This may be particularly likely when mutation rate is high, as appears to be the case for gene duplications, and in pathogen populations where effective population sizes are typically very large. },

One parameter involved in calculating the load minimizing property of the genetic code is codon usage. In most bacteria, synonymous codons are not used with equal frequencies. Different factors have been proposed to contribute to codon usage preference. It has been shown that the codon preference is correlated with the composition of the tRNA pool. Selection for translational efficiency and translational accuracy both result in such a correlation. In this work, it is shown that codon usage bias in Escherichia coli works so as to minimize the consequences of translational errors, i.e. optimized for load minimization. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, prediction methods of such protein fates from their amino acid sequences are reviewed. In many cases, artificial neural network techniques have been effectively used. The prediction of in vivo fates of proteins will be useful for characterizing newly identified candidate genes in a genome or for interpreting multiple spots in proteome analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {If a ribosome shifts to an alternative reading frame during translation, the information in the message is usually lost. We have selected mutants of Salmonella typhimurium with alterations in tRNA(cmo5UGG)(Pro) that cause increased frameshifting when present in the ribosomal P-site. In 108 such mutants, two parts of the tRNA molecule are altered: the anticodon stem and the D-arm, including its tertiary interactions with the variable arm. Some of these alterations in tRNA(cmo5UGG)(Pro) are in close proximity to ribosomal components in the P-site. The crystal structure of the 30S subunit suggests that the C-terminal end of ribosomal protein S9 contacts nucleotides 32-34 of peptidyl-tRNA. We have isolated mutants with defects in the C-terminus of S9 that induce +1 frameshifting. Combinations of changes in tRNA(cmo5UGG)(Pro) and S9 suggest that an interaction occurs between position 32 of the peptidyl-tRNA and the C-terminal end of S9. Together, our results suggest that the cause of frameshifting is an aberrant interaction between the peptidyl-tRNA and the P-site environment. We suggest that the "ribosomal grip" of the peptidyl-tRNA is pivotal for maintaining the reading frame. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. },

This mutation is viable at 25 degrees C, but has a lethal phenotype at 34 degrees C. A search for dosage-dependent suppressors identified five distinct clones that all bear a copy of the tRNA(GUG)(His) gene. Suppression was also observed with a small genomic insert bearing this tRNA gene and no other coding sequences, under conditions where there is a sevenfold increase in the cellular concentration of tRNA(GUG)(His). Overexpressing tRNA(ICG)(Arg), which normally decodes the suppressed CGC codon, counteracted suppression, Suppression is codon specific because it was abolished when replacing CGC by its synonymous codons CGA, CGU, or AGA, but was not detectably affected by several nucleotide substitutions modifying the surrounding sequence and is thus largely insensitive to the nucleotide context. It is proposed that overexpressing tRNA(GUG)(His) extends its decoding properties from CAC(His) to the noncognate CGC(Arg) codon through an illegitimate U.G pairing at the middle base of the anticodon. Accordingly, tRNA(GUG)(His) would compete with tRNA(ICG)(Arg) for chain elongation and generate a significant level of misreading errors under normal growth conditions. },

  Abstract                 = {Diffusion in the bacterial cytoplasm is regarded as the primary method of intracellular protein movement and must play a major role in controlling the rates of cell processes. A number of recent studies have used green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging and fluorescence microscopy to probe the movement and distribution of proteins in the bacterial cytoplasm. However, the dynamic behavior of indigenous proteins must be controlled by a complex mixture of specific interactions, combined with the basic physical constraints imposed by the viscosity and macromolecular crowding of the cytoplasm. These factors are difficult to unravel in studies with indigenous proteins. To what extent the addition of a GFP tag might affect the movement of a protein through the cytoplasm has also remained unknown. To resolve these problems, we have carried out a systematic study of the size dependence of protein diffusion coefficients in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm, using engineered GFP multimers (from 2 to 6 covalently linked GFP molecules). Diffusion coefficients were measured using confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). At least up to 110 kDa (four linked GFP molecules), the diffusion coefficient varies with size roughly as would be predicted from the Einstein-Stokes equation for a classical (Newtonian) fluid. Thus, protein diffusion coefficients are predictable over this range. GFP tagging of proteins has little impact on the diffusion coefficient over this size range and therefore need not significantly perturb protein movement. Two indigenous E. coli proteins were used to show that their specific interactions within the cell are the main controllers of the diffusion rate. },

On randomly sampled leaves, uredinia were counted 9 days after inoculation and urediniospores were collected and quantified every other day from the seventh to the 29th day after inoculation. Increases in inoculum density resulted in progressively smaller increases in uredinial numbers. However, total urediniospore production per leaf was not significantly affected by inoculum, and hence uredinial, density over a range of approximately 10-300 uredinia on the leaf, Total urediniospore production per uredinium generally decreased with increasing inoculum or uredinial density. At high densities, sporulation per uredinium peaked earlier in the sporulation period, had a less distinct peak, and dropped off earlier than for the lower densities. Logistic model fits to cumulative sporulation curves over time revealed that strain SR41 had a greater epidemic rate parameter (r) than SR22 at low and intermediate inoculum or uredinial densities, while SR22 had a higher r-value than SR41 at high density. Both strains also exhibited greater r-values in the presence of the other strain than when alone. Results suggest that strains may have different ecological strategies in their timing of reproduction, and that both intraand interstrain competition can have complex effects on the temporal dynamics of sporulation in pathogen strains. }

  Abstract                 = {The gain in fitness during adaptation depends on the supply of beneficial mutations. Despite a good theoretical understanding of how evolution proceeds for a defined set of mutations, there is little understanding of constraints on net fitnesswhether fitness will reach a limit despite ongoing selection and mutation, and if there is a limit, what determines it. Here, the dsDNA bacteriophage SP6, a virus of Salmonella, was adapted to Escherichia coli K-12. From an isolate capable of modest growth on E. coli, four lines were adapted for rapid growth by protocols differing in use of mutagen, propagation method, and duration, but using the same media, temperature, and a continual excess of the novel host. Nucleotide changes underlying those adaptations differed greatly in number and identity, but the four lines achieved similar absolute fitness at the end, an increase of more than 4000-fold phage descendants per hour. Thus, the fitness landscape allows multiple genetic paths to the same approximate fitness limit. The existence and causes of fitness limits have ramifications to genome engineering, vaccine design, and lethal mutagenesis treatments to cure viral infections.},

  Abstract                 = {The modest correlation between {mRNA} expression and protein abundance in large-scale data sets is explained in part by experimental challenges, such as technological limitations, and in part by fundamental biological factors in the transcription and translation processes. Among various factors affecting the {mRNA}-protein correlation, the roles of biological factors related to translation are poorly understood. In this study, using experimental {mRNA} expression and protein abundance data collected from Desulfovibrio vulgaris by DNA microarray and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomic analysis, we quantitatively examined the effects of several translational-efficiency-related sequence features on {mRNA}-protein correlation. Three classes of sequence features were investigated according to different translational stages: (i) initiation, Shine-Dalgarno sequences, start codon identity, and start codon context; (ii) elongation, codon usage and amino acid usage; and (iii) termination, stop codon identity and stop codon context. Surprisingly, although it is widely accepted that translation initiation is the rate-limiting step for translation, our results showed that the {mRNA}-protein correlation was affected the most by the features at elongation stages, i.e., codon usage and amino acid composition (5.3-15.7\% and 5.8-11.9\% of the total variation of {mRNA}-protein correlation, respectively), followed by stop codon context and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (3.7-5.1\% and 1.9-3.8\%, respectively). Taken together, all sequence features contributed to 15.2-26.2\% of the total variation of {mRNA}-protein correlation. This study provides the first comprehensive quantitative analysis of the {mRNA}-protein correlation in bacterial D. vulgaris and adds new insights into the relative importance of various sequence features in prokaryotic protein translation. },

In this study, we investigate whether a structured 5'-leader or 3'-untranslated region (UTR) affects the cap/poly(A) tail interaction. A structured leader reduced the degree to which the 5'-cap promoted translation in plant cells and inhibited translation from capped and uncapped {mRNA}s equally in yeast, Secondary structure within the 3'-UTR reduced translational efficiency when adjacent to the stop codon but had little effect on the cap/poly(A) tail synergy. The functional interaction between the cap and poly(A) tail was as important for an {mRNA} with a structured leader or 3'-UTR as it was for an unstructured {mRNA} in either species, suggesting that these structures can reduce translation without affecting the functional interaction between the cap and poly(A) tail. However, the loss of Xrn1p, the major 5' -->3' exoribonuclease in yeast, abolished cap-dependent translation and the functional interaction between the cap and poly(A) tail, suggesting that the cap/poly(ii) tail synergy is of particular importance under conditions of active RNA turnover.

These results were determined by (i) simulating a ''morphospace'' containing 200,000 phenotypes reminiscent of early Paleozoic vascular sporophytes, (ii) evaluating the capacity of each morphology to perform each of three tasks (light interception, mechanical support, and reproduction) as well as the ability to reconcile the conflicting morphological requirements for the four combinatorial permutations of these tasks, (iii) simulating the walks obtaining all phenotypic maxima or optima within the seven ''fitness-landscapes,'' and (iv) computing the mean morphological variation attending these walks. The results of these simulations, whose credibility is discussed in the context of early vascular land-plant evolution, suggest that both the number and the accessibility of phenotypic optima increase as the number of functional obligations contributing to total fitness increases (i.e., as the complexity of optimal phenotypes increases, the fitnesses of optima fall closer to the mean fitness of all the phenotypes under selection).},

  Abstract                 = {Thirty years of kinetic studies on tRNA selection in the elongation cycle are reviewed, and confronted with results derived from various sources, including structural studies on the ribosome, genetic observations on ribosome and EF-Tu accuracy mutants, and codon-specific elongation rates. A coherent framework is proposed, which gives meaning to many puzzling effects. Ribosomal accuracy would be governed by a "double-trigger" principle, according to which the ribosome uses energy in the forward direction to create new configurations for tRNA selection, and energy in the backward direction to regain its initial configuration, in particular after a premature dissociation event. The conformation energy would come in part, in Hopfield's mode, from GTP cleavage on the ternary complex (TC). The reset energy would be provided in part, in the author's mode, from GTP cleavage on a binary EF-Tu.GTP complex (BC). There would be several paths for amino acid incorporation. The path of highest accuracy would involve TC binding followed by BC binding, followed either by GTP hydrolysis on the TC, or by TC dissociation and GTP hydrolysis on the BC. Codon-anticodon recognition would occur in at least three kinetically and geometrically distinct stages. In a first stage, there would be a very rapid sorting of the TCs with unstrained anticodons contacting a loosely held mRNA. This stage ends with the anchoring of the codon-anticodon complex by a cluster of three nucleotides of 16S RNA. The second stage would be the most discriminative one. It would operate on the 5 ms time scale and terminate with GTP cleavage on the TC. The third stage would provide a last, crude selection involving "naked" aa-tRNA, partially held back by steric hindrance. Streptomycin and most EF-Tu mutants as well as high accuracy ribosomal mutants would produce specific alterations at stage 2, which are mapped on the stage 2 kinetic mechanism. The ram ribosomal ambiguity mutants, and anticodon position 37 modifications could be markers of stages 1 and 3 selection. Dissociation events at stage 2 or stage 3, when they are not immediately followed by reset events create a leaky state favorable to shortcut incorporation events. These events are equivalent to an "error-prone codon-anticodon mismatch repair". From the recent evidence on ribosome structure, it is conjectured that the L7/L12 flexible stalk of the large ribosome subunit acts as a proofreading gate, and that the alternation of its GTPase activation center between "TCase" competence and "BCase" competence is a main factor in the control of accuracy.

  Abstract                 = {Both DNA replication and transcription are structurally asymmetric processes. An asymmetric nucleotide substitution pattern has been observed between the leading and the lagging strand, and between the coding and the noncoding strand, in eubacterial, viral, and organelle genomes. Similar studies in eukaryotes have been rare, because the origins of replication in nuclear genomes are mostly unknown and the replicons are much shorter than those of prokaryotes. To circumvent these predicaments, all possible pairs of neighboring genes that are located on different strands of nuclear DNA were selected from the complete genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens. For such a pair of genes, one is likely coded from the leading strand and the other from the lagging strand. By examining the introns and the fourfold degenerate sites of codons in the genes of each pair, we found that the relative frequencies of T vs. A and of G vs. C are significantly skewed in most eukaryotes studied. In a gene pair, the potential effects of replicationand transcription-associated mutation bias on strand asymmetry are in the same direction for one gene where leading strand synthesis shares the same template with transcription, while they tend to be canceled out in the other gene. Our study demonstrates that DNA replication-associated and transcription-associated mutation bias and/or selective codon usage bias may affect the strand nucleotide composition asymmetrically in eukaryotic genomes. },

Viable mice homozygous for the deletions were generated and were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates with regard to morphology, reproductive fitness, growth, longevity and a variety of parameters assaying general homeostasis. Further detailed analysis of the expression of multiple genes bracketing the deletions revealed only minor expression differences in homozygous deletion and wild-type mice. Together, the two deleted segments harbour 1,243 non-coding sequences conserved between humans and rodents (more than 100 base pairs, 70\% identity). Some of the deleted sequences might encode for functions unidentified in our screen; nonetheless, these studies further support the existence of potentially 'disposable DNA' in the genomes of mammals.},

One of the candidates for studying the molecules is fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which gleans quantitative information from fluctuating fluorescence signals in a diluted solution. METHODS: Using FCS, the translation products of expression plasmid for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its fusion proteins were measured in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In in vitro translation, the number of products increased linearly for 90 min upon concentration of the plasmid. The autocorrelation function for GFP was fitted with a one-component model with a diffusion time of 0.18 ms, which was identical to the value expected from the molecular weight. In the cases of GFP- tagged hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and glucocorticoid receptor, each fitting result was significantly improved with a two-component model. The slow component with a diffusion time of 6 ms appeared to be related to the ribosome or polysome. In response to the addition of dexamethasone, the nuclear translocation from cytosol clearly induced the decrease in number of molecules in the focal point. CONCLUSIONS: FCS permits monitoring of the number of molecules translated in vitro and in vivo, the translation rate, and the molecular weight.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a web server for the accurate mapping of experimental tags in serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). The core of the server relies on a database of genomic virtual tags built by a recently described method that attempts to reduce the amount of ambiguous assignments for those tags that are not unique in the genome. The method provides a complete annotation of potential virtual SAGE tags within a genome, along with an estimation of their confidence for experimental observation that ranks tags that present multiple matches in the genome. The output of the server consists of a table in HTML format that contains links to a graphic representation of the results and to some external servers and databases, facilitating the tasks of analysis of gene expression and gene discovery. Also, a table in tab delimited text format is produced, allowing the user to export the results into custom databases and software for further analysis. The current server version provides the most accurate and complete SAGE tag mapping source that is available for the yeast organism. In the near future, this server will also allow the accurate mapping of experimental SAGE-tags from other model organisms such as human, mouse, frog and fly. The server is freely available on the web at: http://dna.bio.puc.cl/SAGExplore.html. },

  Abstract                 = {Antibiotic resistance is a clinical and socioeconomical problem that is here to stay. Resistance can be natural or acquired. Some bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , show a high intrinsic resistance to a number of antibiotics whereas others are normally highly antibiotic susceptible such as group A streptococci. Acquired resistance evolve via genetic alterations in the microbes own genome or by horizontal transfer of resistance genes located on various types of mobile DNA elements. Mutation frequencies to resistance can vary dramatically depending on the mechanism of resistance and whether or not the organism exhibits a mutator phenotype. Resistance usually has a biological cost for the microorganism, but compensatory mutations accumulate rapidly that abolish this fitness cost, explaining why many types of resistances may never disappear in a bacterial population. Resistance frequently occurs stepwise making it important to identify organisms with low level resistance that otherwise may constitute the genetic platform for development of higher resistance levels. Self-replicating plasmids, prophages, transposons, integrons and resistance islands all represent DNA elements that frequently carry resistance genes into sensitive organisms. These elements add DNA to the microbe and utilize site-specific recombinases/integrases for their integration into the genome. However, resistance may also be created by homologous recombination events creating mosaic genes where each piece of the gene may come from a different microbe. The selection with antibiotics have informed us much about the various genetic mechanisms that are responsible for microbial evolution.},

Surveys of population structure have been ongoing for decades, but in the past three years, single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) array technology has provided unprecedented detail on human population structure at global and regional scales. These studies have confirmed well-known relationships between distantly related populations and uncovered previously unresolvable relationships among closely related human groups. SNPs represent the first dense genome-wide markers, and as such, their analysis has raised many challenges and insights relevant to the study of population genetics with whole-genome sequences. Here we draw on the lessons from these studies to anticipate the directions that will be most fruitful to pursue during the emerging whole-genome sequencing era.},

We show that, contrary to prior observations, genomic codon usage and tRNA gene frequencies correlate in all kingdoms if these two modifications are taken into account and that presence or absence of these modifications explains patterns of gene expression observed in previous studies. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that human gene expression levels correlate well with genomic codon composition if these identified modifications are considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The standard genetic code table has a distinctly non-random structure, with similar amino acids often encoded by codons series that differ by a single nucleotide substitution, typically, in the third or the first position of the codon. It has been repeatedly argued that this structure of the code results from selective optimization for robustness to translation errors such that translational misreading has the minimal adverse effect. Indeed, it has been shown in several studies that the standard code is more robust than a substantial majority of random codes. However, it remains unclear how much evolution the standard code underwent, what is the level of optimization, and what is the likely starting point. Results: We explored possible evolutionary trajectories of the genetic code within a limited domain of the vast space of possible codes. Only those codes were analyzed for robustness to translation error that possess the same block structure and the same degree of degeneracy as the standard code. This choice of a small part of the vast space of possible codes is based on the notion that the block structure of the standard code is a consequence of the structure of the complex between the cognate tRNA and the codon in mRNA where the third base of the codon plays a minimum role as a specificity determinant. Within this part of the fitness landscape, a simple evolutionary algorithm, with elementary evolutionary steps comprising swaps of four-codon or two-codon series, was employed to investigate the optimization of codes for the maximum attainable robustness. The properties of the standard code were compared to the properties of four sets of codes, namely, purely random codes, random codes that are more robust than the standard code, and two sets of codes that resulted from optimization of the first two sets. The comparison of these sets of codes with the standard code and its locally optimized version showed that, on average, optimization of random codes yielded evolutionary trajectories that converged at the same level of robustness to translation errors as the optimization path of the standard code; however, the standard code required considerably fewer steps to reach that level than an average random code. When evolution starts from random codes whose fitness is comparable to that of the standard code, they typically reach much higher level of optimization than the standard code, i.e., the standard code is much closer to its local minimum (fitness peak) than most of the random codes with similar levels of robustness. Thus, the standard genetic code appears to be a point on an evolutionary trajectory from a random point (code) about half the way to the summit of the local peak. The fitness landscape of code evolution appears to be extremely rugged, containing numerous peaks with a broad distribution of heights, and the standard code is relatively unremarkable, being located on the slope of a moderate-height peak. Conclusion: The standard code appears to be the result of partial optimization of a random code for robustness to errors of translation. The reason the code is not fully optimized could be the trade-off between the beneficial effect of increasing robustness to translation errors and the deleterious effect of codon series reassignment that becomes increasingly severe with growing complexity of the evolving system. Thus, evolution of the code can be represented as a combination of adaptation and frozen accident.

  Abstract                 = {In a constantly changing environment, organisms must continuously adapt or face extinction. J. B. S. Haldane argued that the "cost of natural selection" (also called the cost of substitution) puts an upper limit on the rate of adaptation, and showed that the cost (C) was a decreasing function of the initial frequency of the beneficial alleles. Based on mutation-selection balance and 10\% selective mortality, he suggested that the limit to adaptive evolution was about one allelic substitution per 300 generations. I have tested Haldane's results using simulations of a population limited by density-dependent regulation and subject to a constantly changing environment that affects n (= 1-7) independent survival traits, each controlled by a single locus. I investigated the influence of carrying capacity (K), mutation rate (it), number of beneficial mutations per generation (approximated by M = 2Ku) and net reproductive rate (R). Of these, M has the predominant influence. The effect of large changes in R was relatively small. The cost of selection (C) was measured as the shortest number of generations between an allelic substitution at all loci under selection that was consistent with population persistence. The results differed from Haldane's solution. Across a range of conditions, the cost of Simultaneous selection at n loci was determined by the linear relationship C = C-0(M) + nC(1)(M), where C-0(M) is the intercept and C-1(M) is the slope of the linear regression of C on n, for a given M. The intercept defined a positive fixed cost of substitution, that appears to reflect genetic deaths occurring during the stochastic phase when the beneficial alleles are rare. For M > 1/2, the cost of natural selection is substantially less than Haldane's estimate; however, when M < 1/2, the cost (and particularly the fixed cost) increases in an accelerating fashion as M is lowered. This result has important implications for conserved populations, since for u approximate to 5 x 10(-6) the carrying capacity of the population must be 50000 for M = 1/2. To avoid low M, smaller populations should be linked together into a large metapopulation whenever possible. This large unit would be capable of adapting when the isolated parts could not. It also suggests that if M much less than 1, small gains in K through increases in habitat can have a very large positive influence on the future survival of the population in a changing environment. },

  Abstract                 = {An important criterion used to detect adaptive evolution in DNA sequence data is omega(i) > 1, where omega(i) is the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates in lineage i. However, the evaluation of multiple omega(i) within a phylogenetic tree can easily inflate the statistical type I error rate. We developed two rigorous methods of analysis that avoid this and other potential pitfalls. We applied these methods to four published examples of adaptive evolution. One case was strongly supported by our reanalysis (abalone sperm lysin), and one was weakly supported (baboon alpha-globin), but two examples (primate lysozyme and Antarctic fish beta-globin) did not show significant evidence of adaptive evolution. Our first method is a "bottom-up" hierarchical maximum likelihood approach, which (1) tests for significant heterogeneity in omega across the phylogeny, (2) locates its source using a sequence of planned comparisons, and (3) tests homogeneous groups of omega for omega > 1, using a modified level of significance that incorporates the pretesting. The second method is a "top-down" log-linear analysis based on estimates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions in pairs of lineages. The log-linear test is applied to pairs of lineages joined at progressively deeper nodes. For each pair, the analysis simultaneously tests for adaptive evolution (omega > 1), a shift in natural selection (omega(1) not equal omega(2)), and unequal evolution rate (the relative rate test). In both tests, we emphasized that the criterion omega(1) not equal omega(2) is an important additional indicator of a phylogenetic shift in the balance between natural selection and genetic drift between two related lineages.},

Motivated by these problems, we propose a new type of multivariate logistic distribution that can be used to construct a likelihood for multivariate logistic regression analysis of binary and categorical data. The model for individual outcomes has a marginal logistic structure, simplifying interpretation. We follow a Bayesian approach to estimation and inference, developing an efficient data augmentation algorithm for posterior computation.

  Abstract                 = {Increased expression of the CCU/CCA/CCG-decoding tRNA(3)(Pro) on a multicopy plasmid leads to suppression of several +1 frameshift mutations in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Systematic analysis of the site of frameshifting indicates that excess tRNA(3)(Pro) promotes near-cognate decoding at CCC codons. Re-phasing of the reading frame can be achieved by a subsequent slippage of the tRNA onto a cognate codon in the +1 reading frame. Frameshifting appears to be due to an imbalance of CCC-cognate and near-cognate tRNAs, as the effect of excess tRNA(3)(Pro) on reading frame maintenance can be reversed by increasing simultaneously the concentration of the cognate tRNA(2)(Pro). Finally, the cmo(5)U modification present at position 34 of tRNA(3)(Pro), which allows this tRNA to decode CCU in addition to CCG and CCA, also affects frameshifting, indicating that the ability of the near-cognate tRNA to decode a cognate codon efficiently in the alternative reading frame is important for re-phasing of the reading frame. },

We show that, under many conditions, such sterilizing pathogens evolve high rather than intermediate levels of virulence, and this pushes the pathogen population and sometimes the host population toward extinction. We also show that spatial population structure can reverse this evolutionary result and allow the persistence of intermediate-virulence pathogens. Thus, spatial population structure may be vital to the persistence of sterilizing pathogens in nature.}

HLA-G is most highly expressed in placental cells at the maternal-fetal interface, where it inactivates maternal immune cells, skews the immune system toward a Th2 phenotype, and plays a key role in inducing maternal tolerance toward the genetically foreign fetus. It is also expressed in adult cells, such as bronchial epithelial cells, particularly during inflammatory responses. This gene also may participate in immune responses in the asthmatic lung and influence the cytokine profile in response to inhaled allergens.}

  Abstract                 = {The HLA-G gene is primarily expressed in placental cells that invade the maternal decidua during pregnancy. This gene encodes multiple isoforms that fulfill a variety of functions at the maternal-fetal interface throughout gestation. Recently, a null allele for the most abundant HLA-G isoform was associated with recurrent miscarriage in two independent studies, suggesting that reduced levels of the HLA-G1 protein may compromise successful pregnancy. We initiated the present study to determine whether other polymorphisms that could affect expression levels of HLA-G were associated with fetal loss in women participating in a 15-year prospective study of pregnancy outcome. We genotyped these subjects for 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 1,300 bp upstream of exon 1, 13 of which were identified as part of this study, as well as for an insertion/deletion (in/del) polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region. The 18 SNPs defined eight unique haplotypes. One polymorphism, -725C/G, was associated with fetal loss, with an increased risk for miscarriage in couples in which both partners carried the -725G allele, compared with couples not carrying this allele (odds ratio 2.76, 95\% confidence interval 1.08-7.09; P = .035). Further, the G at nucleotide -725 creates a CpG dinucleotide, and we demonstrate that this CpG site is methylated on -725G alleles. Overall, this study identified extraordinary levels of variation in the 5'-upstream regulatory region of HLA-G and provides evidence for an association between a promoter-region SNP and fetal loss rates, further attesting to the novel features and critical role of this gene in pregnancy. },

However, little is known about the effects in inbred individuals who survive to adulthood. We have investigated the effects of inbreeding on fertility among inbred adult Hutterites and demonstrate significantly reduced fecundity among the most inbred Hutterite women, as evidenced by longer interbirth intervals (P =.024) and longer intervals to a recognized pregnancy (P =.010) but not by increased rates of fetal loss (P >.50). These data suggest the presence of recessive alleles that adversely affect fecundity among the population. In contrast, completed family sizes do not differ among the more and the less-inbred Hutterite women who were born after 1920, suggesting that reproductive compensation is occurring among the more-inbred and less-fecund women. This recent reproductive strategy would facilitate the maintenance of recessive alleles and contribute to an overall decline in fertility in the population. }

Recent biochemical and structural data make it possible to understand at least in outline the structural basis for {tRNA} selection, in which codon recognition by cognate {tRNA} results in the hydrolysis of GTP by EF-Tu over 75 angstrom away. The ribosome recognizes the geometry of codon-anticodon base pairing at the first two positions but monitors the third, or wobble position, less stringently. Part of the additional binding energy of cognate {tRNA} is used to induce conformational changes in the ribosome that stabilize a transition state for GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu and subsequently result in accelerated accommodation of {tRNA} into the peptidyl transferase center. The transition state for GTP hydrolysis is characterized, among other things, by a distorted {tRNA}. This picture explains a large body of data on the effect of antibiotics and mutations on translational fidelity. However, many fundamental questions remain, such as the mechanism of activation of GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu, and the relationship between decoding and frameshifting.},

For one pair of isolates it was shown that the logarithm of the selection coefficient varied linearly with the logarithm of density, and the greatest changes in selection occurred over the lower density changes. Investigation of life history traits showed that the observed differences in selection may have been caused by differences between isolates in the effect of density on spore production.}

Finally, the control of these viruses would be enhanced by collaborative multidisciplinary research into these drivers of emergence. The authors highlight this review with a case study of Nipah virus, which emerged in Malaysia due largely to shifts in livestock production and alterations to reservoir host habitat. Collaboration between virologists, ecologists, disease modelers and wildlife biologists has been instrumental in retracing the factors involved in this virus's emergence. }

These regulatory network models are together sufficiently complex to catch most of the suggested molecular mechanisms responsible for generating dominant mutations. These include reduced gene dosage, expression or protein activity (haploinsufficiency), increased gene dosage, ectopic or temporarily altered {mRNA} expression, increased or constitutive protein activity, and dominant negative effects. As classical genetics regards the phenomenon of dominance to be generated by intralocus interactions, we have studied two one-locus models, one with a negative autoregulatory feedback loop, and one with a positive autoregulatory feedback loop. To include the phenomena of epistasis and downstream regulatory effects, a model of a three-locus signal transduction network is also analyzed. It is found that genetic dominance as well as overdominance may be an intra- as well as interlocus interaction phenomenon. In the latter case the dominance phenomenon is intimately connected to either feedback-mediated epistasis or downstream-mediated epistasis. It appears that in the intra- as well as the inter-locus case there is considerable room for additive gene action, which may explain to some degree the predictive power of quantitative genetic theory,with its emphasis on this type of gene action. Furthermore, the results illuminate and reconcile the prevailing explanations of heterosis, and they support the old conjecture that the phenomenon of dominance may have an evolutionary explanation related to life history strategy.}

Analysis of levels and rates of change in CD4 lymphocyte counts and viral load showed that members within a cluster were no more alike in their rates of change in CD4(+) lymphocyte counts or viral RNA levers than among clusters. Differences in entry viral RNA levels by cluster were marginal and markedly smaller than interindividual differences.

Four of 17 initially seronegative partners seroconverted during 23 person-years of observation. The recipient's clinical status, mononuclear cell subset variations, and time trend in CD4+ counts had no association with transmission. Individual plasma HIV-I ribonucleic acid (RNA) loads were stable during observation, and sexual transmission was not attributable to an upward trend or transient burst in viremia. However, recipients who transmitted HIV-1 to their sexual partners had higher mean viral RNA levels than did nontransmitting recipients (4.3 vs. 3.6 log(10) copies/ml; rho = 0.05). Although this series was small, the prospective observations suggest that viral load was the only characteristic in the recipient that contributed to heterosexual infectiousness.}

The resulting phenotype or fitness is important, since it determines the adaptive potential of a species. To date, most studies have focused on alterations to protein-coding regions of the genome and their consequential fitness effects. Non-protein-coding regulatory regions have been largely neglected, although they make up a large and important part of an organism's genome. Here, we use human immunodeficiency virus type 1 as a model system to investigate fitness effects of random mutations in noncoding DNA-binding sites of the transcriptional promoter. We determined 242 fitness values for 35 viral promoter mutants with one, two, or three mutations across seven distinct cellular environments and identified that (i) all mutants have an effect in at least one cellular environment; (ii) fitness effects are highly dependent on the cellular environment; (iii) disadvantageous and advantageous mutations occur at high and similar frequencies; and (iv) epistatic effects of multiple mutations are rare. Our results underline the evolutionary potential of regulatory regions and indicate that DNA-binding sites evolve under strong selection, while at the same time, they are very plastic to environmental change.},

  Abstract                 = {For a virus population within its host, two important levels of structure can be considered: multiple cell types which can be infected, and tissue types or body compartments which may be coupled via movement. We develop a model with both types of structure. Migration between compartments can create "sources" and "sinks" within the virus population, where realized viral growth rate and abundance is lowered in some compartments compared to what would be observed in isolation. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we investigate how this within-host spatial structure affects the conditions for persistent viral infection. We find that migration between compartments makes the establishment of infection more difficult than it would be in the absence of migration, implying that within-host spatial structure combined with viral movement decreases the likelihood of viral establishment. If migration is symmetrical and compartments are heterogeneous, an increase in migration rates between compartments generally makes establishment less likely. This may help to explain the tissue specificity observed for many viruses. There are, however, important exceptions to this result. These include circumstances where the virus initially invades a compartment that is unfavorable to population growth and migration is necessary to infect other parts of the host body. Stochastic aspects of viral establishment may also favor increased migration as it tends to dampen the amplitude of fluctuations in population size during the initial transient phase of establishment.},

  Abstract                 = {I describe several patterns characterizing the genetics of adaptation at the DNA level. Following Gillespie (1983, 1984, 1991), 1 consider a population presently fixed for the ith best allele at a locus and study the sequential substitution of favorable mutations that results in fixation of the fittest DNA sequence locally available. Given a wild type sequence that is less than optimal, I derive the fitness rank of the next allele typically fixed by natural selection as well as the mean and variance of the jump in fitness that results when natural selection drives a substitution. Looking over the whole series of substitutions required to reach the best allele, I show that the mean fitness jumps occurring throughout an adaptive walk are constrained to a twofold window of values, assuming only that adaptation begins from a reasonably fit allele. I also show that the first substitution and the substitution of largest effect account for a large share of the total fitness increase during adaptation. I further show that the distribution of selection coefficients fixed throughout such an adaptive walk is exponential (ignoring mutations of small effect), a finding reminiscent of that seen in Fisher's geometric model of adaptation. Last, I show that adaptation by natural selection behaves in several respects as the average of two idealized forms of adaptation, perfect and random. },

These genes fall into several functional classes, although a role in transcriptional regulation could prove particularly common. More important, speciation genes are typically very rapidly evolving, and this divergence is often driven by positive Darwinian selection. Finally, I review recent work in Drosophila pseudoobscura on the possible role of meiotic drive in the evolution of the genes that cause postzygotic isolation.},

In particular, these models assume that the distribution of fitness effects among new mutations is in the domain of attraction of the so-called Gumbel-type extreme value distribution. This assumption has not, however, been justified oil ally biological or theoretical grounds. In this note, I study random mutation in one of the simplest models of mutation and adaptation-Fisher's geometric model. I show that random mutation in this model yields a distribution of mutational effects that belongs to the Gumbel type. I also show that the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations in Fisher's model is asymptotically exponential. I confirm these analytic findings with exact computer simulations. These results provide some support for the use of Gumbel-type extreme value theory in studies of adaptation and point to a surprising connection between recent phenotypicand sequence-based models of adaptation: in both, the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations is approximately exponential.

Here I ask whether these results also hold on correlated fitness landscapes, which are smoother than those considered in the mutational landscape model. In particular, I study the genetics of adaptation in the block model, a tunably rugged model of fitness landscapes. Considering the scenario in which adaptation begins from a high fitness wild-type DNA sequence, I use extreme value theory and computer simulations to study both single adaptive steps and entire adaptive walks. I show that all previous results characterizing single steps in adaptation in the mutational landscape model hold at least approximately on correlated landscapes in the block model; many entire-walk results, however, do not. },

Mutations were introduced at alpha 45 His, a position known to be highly intolerant of amino acids other than histidine. To normalize for any variations in expression level, the concentration of wild-type luciferase alpha beta dimer was determined by a novel assay using co-refolding of active/wild-type beta enzyme subunits with inactive alpha subunits in lysate with an excess of exogenously added active alpha subunits. Four His alpha 45 missense mutants of luciferase encoded by leucine codons (CUC, CUU, CUG, and UUG) had histidine misincorporation rates of 2.0 x 10(-6), 1.3 x 10(-6), 9.0 x 10(-8), and 1.5 x 10-8 respectively, a variation of over 133-fold among synonymous codons. Any substantial contribution of mutation was ruled out by a Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test. The two leucine codons with the highest rates, CUU and CUC, have a single central -mismatch to the histidyl-tRNA(QUG) anticodon. Aminoglycoside antibiotics known to enhance mistranslation increased the error rate of the CUC codon more than those of the CUU and CUG codons, consistent with the hypothesis that CUC codon mistranslation arises primarily from miscoding events such as the selection of noncognate histidyl-tRNA(QUG), at the central position of the codon.},

In this paper, we calculate the probability of fixation of beneficial mutations that occur in populations of changing size. We examine a number of demographic models, including a population whose size changes once, a population experiencing exponential growth or decline, one that is experiencing logistic growth or decline, and a population that fluctuates in size. The results are based on a branching process model but are shown to be approximate solutions to the diffusion equation describing changes in the probability of fixation over time. Using the diffusion equation, the probability of fixation of deleterious alleles can also be determined for populations that are changing in size. The results developed in this paper can be used to estimate the fixation flux, defined as the rate at which beneficial alleles fix within a population. The fixation flux measures the rate of adaptive evolution of a population and, as we shall see, depends strongly on changes that occur in population size. },

Protein-coding sequences (CDS) that are contiguous on annotated reference templates and classified as 'Present' in the test strain by hybridization to microarrays are merged into ICs (ICs). These ICs are then extended to account for flanking intergenic sequences. Finally, the lengths of all extended ICs are summated to yield the 'microarray-visualized genome (MVG)' size. We tested and validated ArrayOme using both experimental and in silico-generated genomic hybridization data. MVG sizing of five sequenced \emph{Escherichia coli} and Shigella strains resulted in an accuracy of 97-99\%, as compared to true genome sizes, when the comprehensive ShE.coli meta-array gene sequences (6239 CDS) were used for in silico hybridization analysis. However, the E.coli CFT073 genome size was underestimated by 14\% as this meta-array lacked probes for many CFT073 CDS. ArrayOme permits rapid recognition of discordances between PFGE-measured genome and MVG sizes, thereby enabling high-throughput identification of strains rich in novel genes. Gene discovery studies focused on these strains will greatly facilitate characterization of the global gene pool accessible to individual bacterial species.}

  Abstract                 = {It is well established that exonic sequences contain regulatory elements of splicing that overlap with coding capacity. However, the conflict between ensuring splicing efficiency and preserving the coding capacity for an optimal protein during evolution has not been specifically analyzed. In fact, studies on genomic variability in fields as diverse as clinical genetics and molecular evolution mainly focus on the effect of mutations on protein function. Synonymous variations, in particular, are assumed to be functionally neutral both in clinical diagnosis and when measuring evolutionary distances between species. Using the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exon 12 splicing as a model, we have established that about one quarter of synonymous variations result in exon skipping and, hence, in an inactive CFTR protein. Furthermore, comparative splicing evaluation of mammalian sequence divergences showed that artificial combinations of CFTR exon 12 synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions are incompatible with normal RNA processing. In particular, the combination of the mouse synonymous with the human missense variations causes exon skipping. It follows that there are two sequential levels at which evolutionary selection of genomic variants take place: splicing control and protein function optimization. },

  Abstract                 = {Bacteria with greatly elevated mutation rates (mutators) are frequently found in natural and laboratory populations, and are often associated with clinical infections. Although mutators may increase adaptability to novel environmental conditions, they are also prone to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. The long-term maintenance of high bacterial mutation rates is therefore likely to be driven by rapidly changing selection pressures, in addition to the possible slow transition rate by point mutation from mutators to non-mutators. One of the most likely causes of rapidly changing selection pressures is antagonistic coevolution with parasites. Here we show whether coevolution with viral parasites could drive the evolution of bacterial mutation rates in laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. After fewer than 200 bacterial generations, 25\% of the populations coevolving with phages had evolved 10- to 100-fold increases in mutation rates owing to mutations in mismatch-repair genes; no populations evolving in the absence of phages showed any significant change in mutation rate. Furthermore, mutator populations had a higher probability of driving their phage populations extinct, strongly suggesting that mutators have an advantage against phages in the coevolutionary arms race. Given their ubiquity, bacteriophages may play an important role in the evolution of bacterial mutation rates.},

Advances in systems biology and genomics have facilitated a move from studying individual proteins to characterizing global cellular factors. Systematic surveys indicate that protein evolution is not determined exclusively by selection on protein structure and function, but is also affected by the genomic position of the encoding genes, their expression patterns, their position in biological networks and possibly their robustness to mistranslation. Recent work has allowed insights into the relative importance of these factors. We discuss the status of a much-needed coherent view that integrates studies on protein evolution with biochemistry and functional and structural genomics. },

Here, we expressed the ectodomains of wild-type and mutant TfR and tested those for binding to purified viral capsids and showed that different naturally variant strains of the viruses were associated with variant interactions with the receptors which likely reflect the optimization of the viral infection processes in the different hosts. While all viruses bound the feline TfR, reflecting their tissue culture host ranges, a naturally variant mutant of CPV (represented by the CPV type-2b strain) that became the dominant virus worldwide in 1979 showed significantly lower levels of binding to the feline TfR. The canine TfR ectodomain did not bind to a detectable level in the \emph{in vitro} assays, but this appears to reflect the naturally low affinity of that interaction, as only low levels of binding were seen when the receptor was expressed on mammalian cells; however, that was sufficient to allow endocytosis and infection. The apical domain of the canine TfR controls the specific interaction with CPV capsids, as a canine TfR mutant altering a glycosylation site in that domain bound FPV, CPV-2, and CPV-2b capsids efficiently. Enzymatic removal of the N-linked glycans did not allow FPV binding to the canine TfR, suggesting that the protein sequence difference is itself important. The purified feline TfR inhibited FPV and CPV-2 binding and infection of feline cells but not CPV-2b, indicating that the receptor binding may be able to prevent the attachment to the same receptor on cells. },

On inhibition of lysosomal acidification, EBNA1, the dominant CD4+ T cell antigen of latent Epstein-Barr virus infection, slowly accumulated in cytosolic autophagosomes. In addition, inhibition of autophagy decreased recognition by EBNA1-specific CD4+ T cell clones. Thus, lysosomal processing after autophagy may contribute to MHC class II-restricted surveillance of long-lived endogenous antigens including nuclear proteins relevant to disease.},

Our genomic analysis on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that the number of shared regulatory motifs in the duplicates decreases with evolutionary time, whereas the total number of regulatory motifs remains unchanged. Moreover, genes with numerous paralogs in the yeast genome do not have especially low number of regulatory motifs. These findings indicate that degenerative complementation is not the sole mechanism behind expression divergence in yeast. Moreover, we found some evidence for the action of positive selection on cis-regulatory motifs after gene duplication. These results suggest that the evolution of functional novelty has a substantial role in yeast duplicate gene evolution. },

  Abstract                 = {During most of the 20th cenury, the epidemiology, of tick-borne rickettsioses could be summarized as the occurrence of a single pathogenic rickettsia on each continent. An element of this paradigm suggested that the many other characterized and noncharacterized rickettsiae isolated from ticks were not pathogenic to humans. In this context, it was considered that relatively few tick-borne rickettsiae caused human disease. This concept was modified extensively from 1984 through 2005 by the identification of at least 11hitherto unavailable, such as characterization of virus receptors, the genetic basis of vertebrate resistance to viral infection, and phylogenetic evidence of the history of host range shifts in arboviruses. However, glaring gaps in knowledge of many critical subjects, such as the mechanism of viral persistence and the existence of vertebrate reservoirs, are still evident. Furthermore, with the accumulated data, new questions were raised, such as evolutionary directions of virus virulence and of host range. Although many fundamental questions on the evolution of this unique mode of transmission remained unresolved in the absence of a fossil record, available observations for arboviruses and the information derived from studies in other fields of the biological sciences suggested convergent evolution as a plausible process. Overall, discussion of the diverse range of theories proposed and observations made by many investigators was found to be highly valuable for sorting out the possible mechanism (s) of the emergence of arboviral diseases. additional rickettsial species or subspecies that cause tick-borne rickettsioses around the world. Of these agents, seven were initially isolated from ticks, often years or decades before a definitive association with human disease was established. We present here the tick-borne rickettsioses described through 2005 and focus on the epidemiological circumstances that have played a role in the emergence of the newly recognized diseases. }

  Abstract                 = {Human life expectancy in developed countries has increased steadily for over 150 years, through improvements in public health and lifestyle. More people are hence living long enough to suffer age-related loss of function and disease, and there is a need to improve the health of older people. Ageing is a complex process of damage accumulation, and has been viewed as experimentally and medically intractable. This view has been reinforced by the realization that ageing is a disadvantageous trait that evolves as a side effect of mutation accumulation or a benefit to the young, because of the decline in the force of natural selection at later ages. However, important recent discoveries are that mutations in single genes can extend lifespan of laboratory model organisms and that the mechanisms involved are conserved across large evolutionary distances, including to mammals. These mutations keep the animals functional and pathology-free to later ages, and they can protect against specific ageing-related diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and cancer. Preliminary indications suggest that these new findings from the laboratory may well also apply to humans. Translating these discoveries into medical treatments poses new challenges, including changing clinical thinking towards broad-spectrum, preventative medicine and finding novel routes to drug development. },

Organisms might have evolved the optimal life history, in which survival and fertility late in life are sacrificed for the sake of early reproduction and survival. Alternatively, the life history might be depressed below this optimal compromise by deleterious mutations: because selection against late-acting mutations is weaker, these will impose a greater load on late life. Evidence for the importance of both is emerging, and unravelling their relative importance presents experimentalists with a major challenge. },

Based on this analysis we discuss some of the pitfalls associated with the use of classical statistical techniques for resolving the uncertainties associated with modeling population dynamics. The management of the Serengeti wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) is used as a case study. We fitted a collection of age-structured and unstructured models to a common set of available data and compared model predictions in terms of wildebeest viability and harvest. Models that depicted demographic processes in striking different ways fitted the data equally well. However, upon further analysis it became a clear that models that fit the data equally well could nonetheless have very different management implications. In general, model structure had a much larger effect on viability analysis (e.g., time to collapse) than on optimal harvest analysis (e.g., harvest rate that maximizes harvest). Some modeling decision, such as including age-dependent fertility rates, did not affect management predictions, but others had a strong effect (e.g., choice of model structure). Because several suitable models of comparable complexity fitted the data equally well, traditional model selection methods based on the parsimony principle were not practical for judging the value of alternative models. Our results stress the need to implement analytical framework for population management that explicitly consider the uncertainty about the behavior of natural systems. },

  Abstract                 = {The identification of key environmental forcings responsible for population patterns is a pervasive ecological problem and an important application of time series analysis. A common approach, implemented with methods such as cross-correlation and cross-spectral analysis, relies on matching scales of variability. This approach concludes that a population pattern is caused by a physical factor if their variances share a dominant period. In a nonlinear system, however, forcing at one temporal period can produce a response with variability at one or more different periods. Thus, scale-matching methods will be most successful at establishing cause-effect relationships in linear systems, or close to equilibria, where nonlinear systems are well approximated by linear ones. Here, we propose an alternative approach that does not assume linearity and relies on time series models that are both nonlinear and nonparametric. We specifically apply these models to determine the correct but unknown frequency of a periodic forcing. The time series are generated by simulation of a predator-prey model. Under periodic forcing, this type of model is known to be capable of different dynamic regimes, including chaos and quasiperiodicity, in which the power spectra of population numbers exhibit variance at frequencies other than that of the forcing. We show that nonlinear time series models, built with feedforward neural networks, are able to distinguish the correct forcing period in the predator-prey simulations. These results hold under two common limitations of ecological data: the presence of dynamical and measurement noise, and the availability of time series data for only one variable. We discuss future applications of the approach to more general environmental forcings, other than periodic.}

  Abstract                 = {Several mechanisms that increase the rate of mutagenesis across the entire genome have been identified; however, how the rate of evolution might be promoted in individual genes is unclear. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication(1-4). This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand(1-4). Here we identify the ubiquitous (core) genes in Bacillus subtilis and determine that 17\% of them are on the lagging strand. We find a higher rate of point mutations in the core genes on the lagging strand compared with those on the leading strand, with this difference being primarily in the amino-acid-changing (nonsynonymous) mutations. We determine that, overall, the genes under strong negative selection against amino-acid-changing mutations tend to be on the leading strand, co-oriented with replication. In contrast, on the basis of the rate of convergent mutations, genes under positive selection for amino-acid-changing mutations are more commonly found on the lagging strand, indicating faster adaptive evolution in many genes in the head-on orientation. Increased gene length and gene expression amounts are positively correlated with the rate of accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in the head-on genes, suggesting that the conflict between replication and transcription could be a driving force behind these mutations. Indeed, using reversion assays, we show that the difference in the rate of mutagenesis of genes in the two orientations is transcription dependent. Altogether, our findings indicate that head-on replication-transcription conflicts are more mutagenic than co-directional conflicts and that these encounters can significantly increase adaptive structural variation in the coded proteins. We propose that bacteria, and potentially other organisms, promote faster evolution of specific genes through orientation-dependent encounters between DNA replication and transcription.},

Whether codon preference is linked to cotranslational regulation of polypeptide folding remains unclear. Here, we derive a revised translational efficiency scale that incorporates the competition between tRNA supply and demand. Applying this scale to ten closely related yeast species, we uncover the evolutionary conservation of codon optimality in eukaryotes. This analysis reveals universal patterns of conserved optimal and nonoptimal codons, often in clusters, which associate with the secondary structure of the translated polypeptides independent of the levels of expression. Our analysis suggests an evolved function for codon optimality in regulating the rhythm of elongation to facilitate cotranslational polypeptide folding, beyond its previously proposed role of adapting to the cost of expression. These findings establish how mRNA sequences are generally under selection to optimize the cotranslational folding of corresponding polypeptides.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we present a model of nucleotide substitution in protein-coding regions that also encode the formation of conserved RNA structures. In such regions, apparent evolutionary context dependencies exist, both between nucleotides occupying the same codon and between nucleotides forming a base pair in the RNA structure. The overlap of these fundamental dependencies is sufficient to cause "contagious" context dependencies which cascade across many nucleotide sites. Such large-scale dependencies challenge the use of traditional phylogenetic models in evolutionary inference because they explicitly assume evolutionary independence between short nucleotide tuples. In our model we address this by replacing context dependencies within codons by annotation-specific heterogeneity in the substitution process. Through a general procedure, we fragment the alignment into sets of short nucleotide tuples based on both the protein coding and the structural annotation. These individual tuples are assumed to evolve independently, and the different tuple sets are assigned different annotation-specific substitution models shared between their members. This allows us to build a composite model of the substitution process from components of traditional phylogenetic models. We applied this to a data set of full-genome sequences from the hepatitis C virus where five RNA structures are mapped within the coding region. This allowed us to partition the effects of selection on different structural elements and to test various hypotheses concerning the relation of these effects. Of particular interest, we found evidence of a functional role of loop and bulge regions, as these were shown to evolve according to a different and more constrained selective regime than the nonpairing regions outside the RNA structures. Other potential applications of the model include comparative RNA structure prediction in coding regions and RNA virus phylogenetics. },

However, to date only a small number of isolates have been analysed from different animal hosts in Brazil. In the present study DNA samples of 46 T. gondii isolates from cats in 11 counties in S�o Paulo state, Brazil were genetically characterised using 10 PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism markers including SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1 and Apico. An additional marker, CS3, that locates on chromosome VIIa and has previously been shown to be linked to acute virulence of T. gondii was also used to determine its association to virulence in mice. Genotyping of these 46 isolates revealed a high genetic diversity with 20 genotypes but no clonal Type I, II or III lineage was found. Two of the 46 isolates showed mixed infections. Combining genotyping data in this study with recent reported results from chickens, dogs and cats in Brazil (total 125 isolates) identified 48 genotypes and 26 of these genotypes had single isolates. Four of the 48 genotypes with multiple isolates identified from different hosts and locations are considered the common clonal lineages in Brazil. These lineages are designated as Types BrI, BrII, BrIII and BrIV. These results indicate that the T. gondii population in Brazil is highly diverse with a few successful clonal lineages expanded into wide geographical areas. In contrast to North America and Europe, where the Type II clonal lineage is overwhelmingly predominant, no Type II strain was identified from the 125 Brazil isolates. Analysis of mortality rates in infected mice indicates that Type BrI is highly virulent, Type BrIII is non-virulent, whilst Type BrII and BrIV lineages are intermediately virulent. In addition, allele types at the CS3 locus are strongly linked to mouse-virulence of the parasite. Thus, T. gondii has an epidemic population structure in Brazil and the major lineages have different biological traits.},

  Abstract                 = {Individuals in some species prefer mates carrying dissimilar genes at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which may function to increase the MHC or overall heterozygosity of progeny. Here I review the evidence for MHC-dependent mating preferences from recent studies, including studies on the underlying olfactory mechanisms and evolutionary functions. Many studies indicate that MHC genes influence odour, and some work is beginning to examine the potential role of MHC-linked olfactory receptor genes in mating preferences. MHC-dependent mating preference increases the MHC-heterozygosity of progeny, which is suspected to confer resistance to infectious diseases. In humans, heterozygosity at MHC loci is associated with increased resistance to hepatitis and HIV infections, but experimental evidence for the heterozygote advantage hypothesis has been lacking. Here I re-analyse data from previously published experimental infection studies with mice. I show that although overdominance is rare, resistance is often dominant, suggesting that heterozygotes are often protected. A second (nonmutually exclusive) possibility is that MHC-disassortative mating preferences promotes inbreeding avoidance. This hypothesis is supported by recent evidence that MHC genes play a role in kin recognition, and that mating with close kin has rather deleterious Fitness consequences. In conclusion, I discuss other ways that MHC genes might influence sexual selection. The research on MHC-mediated mating preferences is integrating the study of animal behaviour with other seemingly disparate fields, including sensory biology and immunogenetics. },

  Abstract                 = {Genetic heterozygosity is thought to enhance resistance of hosts to infectious diseases, but few tests of this idea exist. In particular, heterozygosity at the MHC, the highly polymorphic loci that control immunological recognition of pathogens, is suspected to confer a selective advantage by enhancing resistance to infectious diseases (the "heterozygote advantage" hypothesis). To test this hypothesis, we released mice into large population enclosures and challenged them with multiple strains of Salmonella and one of Listeria. We found that during Salmonella infections with three avirulent strains, MHC heterozygotes had greater survival and weight than homozygotes (unlike sham controls), and they were more likely to clear chronic Salmonella infection than homozygotes. In laboratory experiments, we found that MHC heterozygosity enhanced the clearance of multiple-strain Salmonella infections. Yet, contrary to what is widely assumed, the benefits of heterozygosity were due to resistance being dominant rather than overdominant, i.e., heterozygotes were more resistant than the average of parental homozygotes, but they were not more resistant than both. The fact that MHC heterozygotes were more resistant to infection and had higher fitness than homozygotes provides a functional explanation for MHC-disassortative mating preferences. }

In this case, descendants of several of these independent origins may contribute to the fixation. As a consequence, all ancestral haplotypes that are linked to any of these copies will be retained in the population, affecting the pattern of a selective sweep on linked neutral variation. In this study, we use analytical calculations based on coalescent theory and computer simulations to analyze molecular adaptation from recurrent mutation or migration. Under the assumption of complete linkage, we derive a robust analytical approximation for the number of ancestral haplotypes and their distribution in a sample from the population. We find that so-called 'soft sweeps,” where multiple ancestral haplotypes appear in a sample, are likely for biologically realistic values of mutation or migration rates.},

In this study, we present a combination of analytical and simulation results to demonstrate the effect of adaptation from recurrent mutation on summary statistics for polymorphism data from a linked neutral locus. We also analyze the power of standard neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum or on linkage disequilibrium (LD) under this scenario. For recurrent beneficial mutation at biologically realistic rates, we find substantial deviations from the classical pattern of a selective sweep from a single new mutation. Deviations from neutrality in the level of polymorphism and in the frequency spectrum are much less pronounced than in the classical sweep pattern. In contrast, for levels of LD, the signature is even stronger if recurrent beneficial mutation plays a role. We suggest a variant of existing LD tests that increases their power to detect this signature.},

In this Review we survey the research on the host jumps of influenza A, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, canine parvovirus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus to illustrate the insights that can arise from combining genetic surveillance with microbiological experimentation in the context of epidemiological data. We argue that using a multidisciplinary approach for surveillance will provide a better understanding of when adaptations are required for host jumps and thus when predictive genetic markers may be present.},

Mutational pressure at the wobble position was estimated from the base composition of the noncoding portion of the yeast genome. The selective pressure for translational efficiency was inferred from the degree of codon adaptation to {tRNA} gene redundancy and from {mRNA} abundance data derived from yeast transcriptome analysis. Amino acid conservation in orthologous comparisons with wholly sequenced microbial genomes was used to estimate translational accuracy requirements. A close correspondence was observed between the usage of wobble position pyrimidines and the frequency predicted by mutational bias. However, in the case of four cognate pairs (Gly: ggu/ggc; Asn: aau/aac; Phe: uuu/uuc; Tyr: uau/uac) all read by guanosine-starting anticodons, we found evidence for a strong selective pressure driven by translational efficiency. Only for the glycine pair, wobble pyrimidine choice also appears to fulfill a translational accuracy requirement. Wobble pyrimidine selection is strictly related to the number of hydrogen bonds formed by alternative cognate codons: whenever a different number of hydrogen bonds can be formed at the wobble position, there is selection against sixor nine-hydrogen-bonded codon-anticodon pairs. Our results indicate that an intrinsic codon preference, critically dependent on the stability of codon-anticodon interaction and mainly reflecting selection for the optimization of translational efficiency, is built into the translational apparatus.}

Results: We studied protein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, complexes of known three-dimensional structure in the Protein Data Bank and clusters of pairwise protein interactions in the networks of several organisms. We found that duplication of homomeric interactions, a large class of protein interactions, frequently results in the formation of complexes of paralogous proteins. This route is a common mechanism for the evolution of complexes and clusters of protein interactions. Our conclusions are further confirmed by theoretical modelling of network evolution. We propose reasons for why this is favourable in terms of structure and function of protein complexes. Conclusion: Our study provides the first insight into the evolution of functional modularity in protein-protein interaction networks, and the origins of a large class of protein complexes. },

By comparing these models to data obtained from patients undergoing antiretroviral drug therapy, it has been possible to determine many quantitative features of the interaction between HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, and the cells that are infected by the virus. The most dramatic finding has been that even though AIDS is a disease that occurs on a time scale of about 10 years, there are very rapid dynamical processes that occur on time scales of hours to days, as well as slower processes that occur on time scales of weeks to months. We show how dynamical modeling and parameter estimation techniques have uncovered these important features of HIV pathogenesis and impacted the way in which AIDS patients are treated with potent antiretroviral drugs. },

Ten crossbreed adult horses, clinically healthy, weighing 380-470 kg body weight (bw) were selected for study. Faecal examinations were performed to determine faecal parasite egg counts. Horses were allocated to two groups of five animals to provide an even distribution considering the variables sex, body weight and faecal egg count. Group I, were treated with an oral paste formulation of IVM at 0.2 mg/kg b/w and Group II, were treated with an oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg bw of DRM prepared as paste from [lie injectable formulation for oral administration. Blood samples were collected by jugular puncture between 0 h and 75 days post-treatment. Plasma was separated and later solid phase extraction and derivatization samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); a computerised kinetic analysis was carried out. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The mean plasma concentrations of DRM and IVM after oral administration in horses were detected until 30 and 20 days, respectively. Both drugs showed similar patterns of absorption and no significant differences were found for peak concentration, the time to peal, concentration, or for absorptive half-life. The terminal elimination half-life was significantly (P< 0.05) longer in the DRM treated group than for the RAT treated group. The differences observed in the elimination half-life explain the longer mean residence time and high values of area under the concentration time curve for the group treated with DRM, which are 30\% higher than those of the IVM group. Considering its pharmacokinetics, tolerance and anthelmintic efficacy, the oral administration of DRM, could be an alternative to IVM for the control of parasitic diseases of horses.

Ten clinically healthy adult horses, weighing 380-496 kg body weight (BW), were allocated to two experimental groups of five horses. Group 1, was treated with an oral paste formulation of IVM at the manufacturer's recommended dose of 0.2 mg/kg BW. Group II, was treated IM with an injectable 1\% formulation of IVM at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg BW. Blood samples were collected by jugular puncture at different times between 0.5 h and 75 days post-treatment. After plasma extraction and derivatization, samples were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. A computerized kinetic analysis was performed, and data were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The parent molecule was detected in plasma between 30 min and either 20 (oral) or 40 (IM) days post-treatment. Significant differences were found for the time corresponding to peak plasma concentrations (t(max)) and for absorption half-life. Peak plasma concentrations (C-max) of 51.3 +/- 16.1 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) were obtained after oral administration and of 31.4 +/- 6.0 ng/ml for the IM route. The values for area under concentration-time curve were 137.1 +/- 35.9 ng day/ml for the group treated orally, and 303.2 +/- 4.3 ng day/ml for the IM treated group. The mean plasma residence times were 4.2 +/- 0.4 and 8.9 +/- 0.7 days for oral and IM-treated groups, respectively. The results of this study show that the route of administration considerably affects the disposition of IVM. A significant difference in bioavailabilty and half-life of elimination of IVM was observed after IM administration compared with oral administration. A close relationship between pharmacokinetic profiles and the clinical efficacy of IVM was established. }

  Abstract                 = {Correspondence analysis has frequently been used for codon usage studies but this method is often misused. Because amino acid composition exerts constraints on codon usage, it is common to use tables containing relative codon frequencies (or ratios of frequencies) instead of simple codon counts to get rid of these amino acid biases. The problem is that some important properties of correspondence analysis, such as rows weighting, are lost in the process. Moreover, the use of relative measures sometimes introduces other biases and often diminishes the quantity of information to analyse, occasionally resulting in interpretation errors. For instance, in the case of an organism such as Borrelia burgdorferi, the use of relative measures led to the conclusion that there was no translational selection, while analyses based on codon counts show that there is a possibility of a selective effect at that level. In this paper, we expose these problems and we propose alternative strategies to correspondence analysis for studying codon usage biases when amino acid composition effects must be removed. },

The functions of the factors and the sequence in which ribosomal subunits, {tRNA}, and {mRNA} are released from posttermination complexes are unclear and, in part, controversial. Here, we study the reaction by rapid kinetics monitoring fluorescence. We show that RRF and EF-G with GTP, but not with GDPNP, promote the dissociation of 50S subunits from the posttermination complex without involving translocation or a translocation-like event. IF3 does not affect subunit dissociation but prevents reassociation, thereby masking the dissociating effect of EFG-RRF under certain experimental conditions. IF3 is required for the subsequent ejection of {tRNA} and {mRNA} from the small subunit. The latter step is slower than subunit dissociation and constitutes the rate-limiting step of ribosome recycling. },

  Abstract                 = { Host-parasite coevolution has been shown to provide an advantage to recombination, but the selective mechanism underlying this advantage is unclear. One possibility is that recombination increases the frequency of advantageous genotypes that are disproportionately rare because of fluctuating epistasis. However, for this mechanism to work, epistasis for fitness must fluctuate over a very narrow timescale: two to five generations. Alternatively, recombination may speed up the response to directional selection by breaking up linkage disequilibria that decrease additive genetic variance. Here we analyze the results of a numerical simulation of host-parasite coevolution to assess the importance of these two mechanisms. We find that linkage disequilibria may tend to increase, rather than decrease, additive genetic variance. In addition, the sign of epistasis changes every two to five generations under several of the parameter values investigated, and epistasis and linkage disequilibrium are frequently of opposite signs. These results are consistent with the idea that selection for recombination is mediated by fluctuating epistasis. Finally, we explore the conditions under which an allele causing free recombination can spread in a nonrecombining host population and find general agreement between the predictions of a population genetic model of fluctuating epistasis and our simulation model. },

  Abstract                 = {Selection on pathogens tends to favour the evolution of growth and reproductive rates and a concomitant level of virulence (damage done to the host) that maximizes pathogen fitness. Yet, because hosts often pose varying selective environments to pathogens, one level of virulence may not be appropriate for all host types. Indeed, if a level of virulence confers high fitness to the pathogen in one host phenotype but low fitness in another host phenotype, alternative virulence strategies may be maintained in the pathogen population. Such strategies can occur either as polymorphism, where different strains of pathogen evolve specialized virulence strategies in different host phenotypes or as polyphenism, where pathogens facultatively express alternative virulence strategies depending on host phenotype. Polymorphism potentially leads to specialist pathogens capable of infecting a limited range of host phenotypes, whereas polyphenism potentially leads to generalist pathogens capable of infecting a wider range of hosts. Evaluating how variation among hosts affects virulence evolution can provide insight into pathogen diversity and is critical in determining how host-pathogen interactions affect the phenotypic evolution of both hosts and pathogens. }

Frameshift suppressor tRNAs generally contain an extra nucleotide in the anticodon loop and they subvert the normal mechanisms used by the ribosome for frame maintenance. The mechanism by which suppressor tRNAs traverse the ribosome during translocation. is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate translocation of a tRNA by four nucleotides from the A site to the P site, and from the P site to the E site. We show that translocation of a punctuated mRNA is possible with an extra, unpaired nucleotide between codons. Interestingly, the NMR structure of the four nucleotide anticodon stem-loop reveals a conformation different from the canonical tRNA structure. Flexibility within the loop may allow conformational adjustment upon A site binding and for interacting with the four nucleotide codon in order to shift the mRNA reading frame. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Chromatin at centromeres is distinct from the chromatin in which the remainder of the genome is assembled. Two features consistently distinguish centromeres: the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A and, in most organisms, the presence of heterochromatin. In fission yeast, domains of silent 'heterochromatin' flank the CENP-A chromatin domain that forms a platform upon which the kinetochore is assembled. Thus, fission yeast centromeres resemble their metazoan counterparts where the kinetochore is embedded in centromeric heterochromatin. The centromeric outer repeat chromatin is underacetylated on histories H3 and H4, and methylated on lysine 9 of histone H3, which provides a binding site for the chromodomain protein Swi6 (orthologue of Heterochromatin Protein 1, HP1). The remarkable demonstration that the assembly of repressive heterochromatin is dependent on the RNA interference machinery provokes many questions about the mechanisms of this process that may be tractable in fission yeast. Heterochromatin ensures that a high density of cohesin is recruited to centromeric regions, but it could have additional roles in centromere architecture and the prevention of merotely, and it might also act as a trigger for kinetochore assembly. In addition, we discuss an epigenetic model for ensuring that CENP-A is targeted and replenished at the kinetochore domain. },

  Abstract                 = {The tri-frame model gives mathematical expression to the transcription and translation processes, and considers all three reading frames (RFs). RNA polymerases transcribe DNA in single nucleotide increments, but ribosomes translate mRNA in pairings of three (triplets or codons). The set of triplets in the mRNA, starting with the initiation codon (usually AUG) defines the open reading frame (ORF). Since ribosomes do not always translocate three nucleotide positions, two additional RFs are accessible. The -1 RF and the +1 RF are triplet pairings of the mRNA, which are accessed by shifting one nucleotide position in the 5' and 3' directions, respectively. Transcription is modeled as a linear operator that maps the initial codons in all three frames into other codon sets to account for possible transcriptional errors. Translational errors (missense errors) originate from misacylation of tRNAs and misreading of aa-tRNAs by the ribosome. Translation is modeled as a linear mapping from codons into aa-tRNA species, which includes misreading errors. A final transformation from aa-tRNA species into amino acids provides the probability distributions of possible amino acids into which the codons in all three frames could be translated. An important element of the tri-frame model is the ribosomal occupancy probability. It is a vector in R(3) that gives the probability to find the ribosome in the ORF, -1 or +1 RF at each codon position. The sequence of vectors, from the first to the final codon position, gives a history of ribosome frameshifting. The model is powerful: it provides explicit expressions for (1) yield of error-free protein, (2) fraction of prematurely terminated polypeptides, (3) number of transcription errors, (4) number of translation errors and (5) mutations due to frameshifting. The theory is demonstrated for the three genes rpsU, dnaG and rpoD of Escherichia coli, which lie on the same operon, as well as for the prfB gene.},

  Abstract                 = {Sewall Wright introduced the metaphor of evolution Oil "adaptive landscapes" in a pair of papers published in 1931 and 1932. The metaphor has been one of the Most influential in modern evolutionary biology, although recent theoretical advancements show that it is deeply flawed and may have actually created research questions that are not, in fact, fecund. In this paper I examine in detail what Wright actually said in the 1932 paper, its well as what he thought of the matter at the very end of his career, in 1988. While the metaphor is flawed, some of the problems which Wright was attempting to address are still with LIS today, and are in the process of being reformulated as part of a forthcoming Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.},

  Abstract                 = {For decades, unicellular yeasts have been general models to help understand the eukaryotic cell and also our own biology. Recently, over a dozen yeast genomes have been sequenced, providing the basis to resolve several complex biological questions. Analysis of the novel sequence data has shown that the minimum number of genes from each species that need to be compared to produce a reliable phylogeny is about 20. Yeast has also become an attractive model to study speciation in eukaryotes, especially to understand molecular mechanisms behind the establishment of reproductive isolation. Comparison of closely related species helps in gene annotation and to answer how many genes there really are within the genomes. Analysis of non-coding regions among closely related species has provided an example of how to determine novel gene regulatory sequences, which were previously difficult to analyse because they are short and degenerate and occupy different positions. Comparative genomics helps to understand the origin of yeasts and points out crucial molecular events in yeast evolutionary history, such as whole-genome duplication and horizontal gene transfer(s). In addition, the accumulating sequence data provide the background to use more yeast species in model studies, to combat pathogens and for efficient manipulation of industrial strains.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of the immune system are providing us with ever more detailed information on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie our evolutionarily conserved ability to fend off infectious pathogens. Progress has probably been fastest at two levels: the various basic biological functions of isolated cells on one side and the significance of individual molecules or cells to the organism as a whole on the other. In both cases, direct phenomenological observation has been an invaluable methodological approach. Where we know least is the middle ground, i.e. how immune functions are integrated through the dynamic interplay of immune cell subsets within the organism. Most of our knowledge in this area has been obtained through inference from static snapshots of dynamic processes, such as histological sections, or from surrogate cell co-culture models. The latter are employed under the assumption that an in vivo equivalent exists for each type of cellular contact artificially enforced in absence of anatomical compartmentalization. In this review, we summarize recent insights on migration and effector functions of T cells, focusing on observations gained from their dynamic microscopic visualization in physiological tissue environments. },

  Abstract                 = {Background. Decoding of mRNAs is performed by aminoacyl tRNAs (aa-tRNAs). This process is highly accurate, however, at low frequencies (10(-3)-10(-4)) the wrong aa-tRNA can be selected, leading to incorporation of aberrant amino acids. Although our understanding of what constitutes the correct or cognate aa-tRNA: mRNA interaction is well defined, a functional distinction between near-cognate or single mismatched, and unpaired or non-cognate interactions is lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings. Misreading of several synonymous codon substitutions at the catalytic site of firefly luciferase was assayed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of the results in the context of current kinetic and biophysical models of aa-tRNA selection suggests that the defining feature of near-cognate aa-tRNAs is their potential to form mini-helical structures with A-site codons, enabling stimulation of GTPase activity of eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1A (eEF1A). Paromomycin specifically stimulated misreading of near-cognate but not of non-cognate aa-tRNAs, providing a functional probe to distinguish between these two classes. Deletion of the accessory elongation factor eEF1B gamma promoted increased misreading of near-cognate, but hyperaccurate reading of non-cognate codons, suggesting that this factor also has a role in tRNA discrimination. A mutant of eEF1B alpha, the nucleotide exchange factor for eEF1A, promoted a general increase in fidelity, suggesting that the decreased rates of elongation may provide more time for discrimination between aa-tRNAs. A mutant form of ribosomal protein L5 promoted hyperaccurate decoding of both types of codons, even though it is topologically distant from the decoding center. Conclusions/Signficance. It is important to distinguish between near-cognate and non-cognate mRNA: tRNA interactions, because such a definition may be important for informing therapeutic strategies for suppressing these two different categories of mutations underlying many human diseases. This study suggests that the defining feature of near-cognate aa-tRNAs is their potential to form mini-helical structures with A-site codons in the ribosomal decoding center. An aminoglycoside and a ribosomal factor can be used to distinguish between near-cognate and non-cognate interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Selection pressures on proteins are usually measured by comparing homologous nucleotide sequences (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1965). Recently we introduced a novel method, termed volatility, to estimate selection pressures on proteins on the basis of their synonymous codon usage (Plotkin and Dushoff 2003; Plotkin et al. 2004). Here we provide a theoretical foundation for this approach. Under the Fisher-Wright model, we derive the expected frequencies of synonymous codons as a function of the strength of selection on amino acids, the mutation rate, and the effective population size. We analyze the conditions under which we can expect to draw inferences from biased codon usage, and we estimate the time scales required to establish and maintain such a signal. We find that synonymous codon usage can reliably distinguish between negative selection and neutrality only for organisms, such as some microbes, that experience large effective population sizes or periods of elevated mutation rates. The power of volatility to detect positive selection is also modest-requiring approximately 100 selected sites-but it depends less strongly on population size. We show that phenomena such as transient hyper-mutators can improve the power of volatility to detect selection, even when the neutral site heterozygosity is low. We also discuss several confounding factors, neglected by the Fisher-Wright model, that may limit the applicability of volatility in practice. }

Here, we introduce a simple regression technique for estimating selection pressures on all proteins in a genome, on the basis of limited comparative data. The regression technique does not depend on an underlying population-genetic mechanism.

We catalogue the relative strength of selection on each gene in the entire genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. Our analysis confirms that most antigens are under strong selection for amino-acid substitutions, particularly the PE/PPE family(2) of putative surface proteins in M. tuberculosis and the EMP1 family(3) of cytoadhering surface proteins in P. falciparum. We also identify many uncharacterized proteins that are under strong selection in each pathogen. We provide a genome-wide analysis of natural selection acting on different stages of an organism's life cycle: genes expressed in the ring stage(4) of P. falciparum are under stronger positive selection than those expressed in other stages of the parasite's life cycle. Our method of estimating selective pressures requires far fewer data than comparative sequence analysis, and it measures selection across an entire genome; the method can readily be applied to a large range of sequenced organisms. }

Our findings suggest that codon-mediated translational control may play an important role in the differentiation and regulation of tissue-specific gene products in humans.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract There have been two different schools of thought on the evolution of dominance. On the one hand, followers of Wright [Wright S. 1929. Am. Nat. 63: 274{\textendash}279, Evolution: Selected Papers by Sewall Wright, University of Chicago Press, Chicago; 1934. Am. Nat. 68: 25{\textendash}53, Evolution: Selected Papers by Sewall Wright, University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Haldane J.B.S. 1930. Am. Nat. 64: 87{\textendash}90; 1939. J. Genet. 37: 365{\textendash}374; Kacser H. and Burns J.A. 1981. Genetics 97: 639{\textendash}666] have defended the view that dominance is a product of non-linearities in gene expression. On the other hand, followers of Fisher [Fisher R.A. 1928a. Am. Nat. 62: 15{\textendash}126; 1928b. Am. Nat. 62: 571{\textendash}574; B\~{u}rger R. 1983a. Math. Biosci. 67: 125{\textendash}143; 1983b.

Rev. 72: 97{\textendash}110] have argued that dominance evolved via selection on modifier genes. Some have called these {\textquotedblleft}physiological{\textquotedblright} versus {\textquotedblleft}selectionist,{\textquotedblright} or more recently [Falk R. 2001. Biol. Philos. 16: 285{\textendash}323], {\textquotedblleft}functional,{\textquotedblright} versus {\textquotedblleft}structural{\textquotedblright} explanations of dominance. This paper argues, however, that one need not treat these explanations as exclusive. While one can disagree about the most likely evolutionary explanation of dominance, as Wright and Fisher did, offering a {\textquotedblleft}physiological{\textquotedblright} or developmental explanation of dominance does not render dominance {\textquotedblleft}epiphenomenal,{\textquotedblright} nor show that evolutionary considerations are irrelevant to the maintenance of dominance, as some [Kacser H. and Burns J.A. 1981. Genetics 97: 639{\textendash}666] have argued. Recent work [Gilchrist M.A. and Nijhout H.F. 2001. Genetics 159: 423{\textendash}432] illustrates how biological explanation is a multi-level task, requiring both a {\textquotedblleft}top-down{\textquotedblright} approach to understanding how a pattern of inheritance or trait might be maintained in populations, as well as {\textquotedblleft}bottom-up{\textquotedblright} modeling of the dynamics of gene expression. },

  Abstract                 = {Wildlife are now recognised as an important source of emerging human pathogens, including parasites. This paper discusses the linkages between wildlife, people, zoonotic parasites and the ecosystems in which they co-exist, revisits definitions for 'emerging' and 're-emerging', and lists zoonotic parasites that can be acquired from wildlife including, for some, estimates of the associated global human health burdens. The paper also introduces the concepts of 'parasite webs' and 'parasite flow', provides a context for parasites, relative to other infectious agents, as causes of emerging human disease, and discusses drivers of disease emergence and re-emergence, especially changes in biodiversity and climate. Angiostrongylus cantonensis in the Caribbean and the southern United States, Baylisascaris procyonis in California and Georgia, Plasmodium knowlesi in Sarawak, Malaysia, Human African Trypanosomiasis, Sarcoptes scabiei in carnivores, and Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Toxoplasma in marine ecosystems are presented as examples of wildlife-derived zoonotic parasites of particular recent interest. An ecological approach to disease is promoted, as is a need for an increased profile for this approach in undergraduate and graduate education in the health sciences. Synergy among scientists and disciplines is identified as critical for the study of parasites and parasitic disease in wildlife populations. Recent advances in techniques for the investigation of parasite fauna of wildlife are presented and monitoring and surveillance systems for wildlife disease are discussed. Some of the limitations inherent in predictions for the emergence and re-emergence of infection and disease associated with zoonotic parasites of wildlife are identified. The importance of public awareness and public education in the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infection and disease are emphasised. Finally, some thoughts for the future are presented. (c) 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract                 = {The process of amino acid replacement in proteins is context-dependent, with substitution rates influenced by local structure, functional role, and amino acids at other locations. Predicting how these differences affect replacement processes is difficult. To make such inference easier, it is often assumed that the acceptabilities of different amino acids at a position are constant. However, evolutionary interactions among residue positions will tend to invalidate this assumption. Here, we use simulations of purple acid phosphatase evolution to show that amino acid propensities at a position undergo predictable change after an amino acid replacement at that position. After a replacement, the new amino acid and similar amino acids tend to become gradually more acceptable over time at that position. In other words, proteins tend to equilibrate to the presence of an amino acid at a position through replacements at other positions. Such a shift is reminiscent of the spectroscopy effect known as the Stokes shift, where molecules receiving a quantum of energy and moving to a higher electronic state will adjust to the new state and emit a smaller quantum of energy whenever they shift back down to the original ground state. Predictions of changes in stability in real proteins show that mutation reversals become less favorable over time, and thus, broadly support our results. The observation of an evolutionary Stokes shift has profound implications for the study of protein evolution and the modeling of evolutionary processes.},

Relative to the great apes, the human karyotype has one fewer chromosome pair, as human chromosome 2 derived from the telomeric fusion of two ancestral primate chromosomes. To identify the genomic rearrangements that accompanied human speciation, we initiated a comparative study between human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Using the HAPPY mapping method, an acellular adaptation of the radiation hybrid method, we mapped a few hundred markers on the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla genomes. This allowed us to identify several chromosome rearrangements, in particular a pericentric inversion and a translocation. We precisely localized the synteny breakpoint that led to the formation of human chromosome 2. This breakpoint was confirmed by FISH mapping. }

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated the reduction of fitness caused by the fixation of new deleterious mutations in small populations within the framework of Fisher's geometrical model of adaptation. In Fisher's model, a population evolves in an n-dimensional character space with an adaptive optimum at the origin. The model allows us to investigate compensatory mutations, which restore fitness losses incurred by other mutations, in a context-dependent manner. We have conducted a moment analysis of the model, supplemented by the numerical results of computer simulations. The mean reduction of fitness (i.e., expected load) scaled to one is approximately nl(n+2N(e)), where N-e is the effective population size. The reciprocal relationship between the load and N-e implies that the fixation of deleterious mutations is unlikely to cause extinction when there is a broad scope for compensatory mutations, except in very small populations. Furthermore, the dependence of load on n implies that pleiotropy plays a large role in determining the extinction risk of small populations. Differences and similarities between our results and those of a previous study on the effects of N-e and n are explored. That the predictions of this model are qualitatively different from studies ignoring compensatory mutations implies that we must be cautious in predicting the evolutionary fate of small populations and that additional data on the nature of mutations is of critical importance. },

We present a robust method to extract codon translation rates and protein synthesis rates from these data, and identify causal features associated with elongation and translation efficiency in physiological conditions in yeast. We show that neither elongation rate nor translational efficiency is improved by experimental manipulation of the abundance or body sequence of the rare AGG tRNA. Deletion of three of the four copies of the heavily used ACA tRNA shows a modest efficiency decrease that could be explained by other rate-reducing signals at gene start. This suggests that correlation between codon bias and efficiency arises as selection for codons to utilize translation machinery efficiently in highly translated genes. We also show a correlation between efficiency and RNA structure calculated both computationally and from recent structure probing data, as well as the Kozak initiation motif, which may comprise a mechanism to regulate initiation.},

  Abstract                 = {Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein is a non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein expressed primarily in cartilage, ligament, and tendon. Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein has been studied extensively because mutations in the gene cause two skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Pseudoachondroplasia is a disproportionate dwarfing condition associated with joint abnormalities, while multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is less severe. Both of these skeletal dysplasias have a characteristic chondrocyte pathology that consists of intracellular retention of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and other extracellular matrix proteins in an enlarged rough endoplasmic reticulum. This toxic intracellular retention of extracellular matrix proteins causes chondrocyte cell death thereby decreasing linear bone growth. Additionally, when cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and the other co-retained proteins are not exported to the extracellular matrix, the resulting matrix is abnormal and easily erodes with normal physical activity. Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein is also a marker for joint destruction associated osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, joint trauma, and intense activity. Serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein levels are higher in aggressive cases of arthritis and levels are used to predict future disease progression. Recent studies have identified molecular functions of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein that may contribute to its role in skeletal disease. These molecular functions include: binding other ECM proteins, catalyzing polymerization of type II collagen fibrils, and regulation of chondrocyte proliferation. Here, we review cartilage oligomeric matrix protein's role in skeletal disease and potential molecular mechanisms.},

Also, the sequence of the end oft he S7 gene, the S7-G intercistronic region, and the beginning of the elongation fractor G gene is reported. The S12-S7 intercistronic region is 96 base pairs long, in contrast to other intercistronic regions in r-protein operons which have been found to vary from 3 to 66 base pairs. The S7-G intercistronic region is only 27 bases long, supporting the previous conclusion that r-protein and elongation factor genes are co-transcribed. A comparison of translation initiation sites of the S12 and S7 genes, and other examples of co-transcribed r-protein genes, reveals no obvious features that could account for equimolar synthesis of all rproteins. The codon usage in the 512 and S7 genes follows the pattern observed in other r-protein genes; that is, there is a highly preferential usage of codons recognized by the most abundant of isoaccepting {tRNA} species. This pattern could reflect the cell's need for efficient translation or minimal errors, or both, in rprotein synthesis.},

At the heart of these computational methods is an energy function that calculates the free energy of the system. Many of these functions were also developed to estimate the consequence of mutation on protein stability or binding affinity. In the current study, we chose six different methods that were previously reported as being able to predict the change in protein stability ({Delta}{Delta}G) upon mutation: CC/PBSA, EGAD, FoldX, I-Mutant2.0, Rosetta and Hunter. We evaluated their performance on a large set of 2156 single mutations, avoiding for each program the mutations used for training. The correlation coefficients between experimental and predicted {Delta}{Delta}G values were in the range of 0.59 for the best and 0.26 for the worst performing method. All the tested computational methods showed a correct trend in their predictions, but failed in providing the precise values. This is not due to lack in precision of the experimental data, which showed a correlation coefficient of 0.86 between different measurements. Combining the methods did not significantly improve prediction accuracy compared to a single method. These results suggest that there is still room for improvement, which is crucial if we want forcefields to perform better in their various tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {The NEWUOA software seeks the least value of a function F ( x ), x \u2208 R n , when F ( x ) can be calculated for any vector of variables x . The algorithm is iterative, a quadratic model Q \u2248 F being required at the beginning of each iteration, which is used in a trust region procedure for adjusting the variables. When Q is revised, the new Q interpolates F at m points, the value m = 2 n + 1 being recommended. The remaining freedom in the new Q is taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to \u2207 2 Q . Only one interpolation point is altered on each iteration. Thus, except for occasional origin shifts, the amount of work per iteration is only of order ( m + n ) 2 , which allows n to be quite large. Many questions were addressed during the development of NEWUOA, for the achievement of good accuracy and robustness. They include the choice of the initial quadratic model, the need to maintain enough linear independence in the interpolation conditions in the presence of computer rounding errors, and the stability of the updating of certain matrices that allow the fast revision of Q . Details are given of the techniques that answer all the questions that occurred. The software was tried on several test problems. Numerical results for nine of them are reported and discussed, in order to demonstrate the performance of the software for up to 160 variables.},

Much of what has been learnt from these studies about the subtlety of the microevolutionary process also has significant implications for experimental design and inference in organismal biology beyond life-history evolution, as well as for studies of evolution in the wild. Here we review work on the ecology and evolution of life-histories in laboratory populations of D. melanogaster, emphasizing how environmental effects on life-history-related traits can influence evolutionary change. We discuss life-history tradeoffs many unexpected-revealed by selection experiments, and also highlight recent work that underscores the importance to life-history evolution of cross-generation and cross-life-stage effects and interactions, sexual antagonism and sexual dimorphism, population dynamics, and the possible role of biological clocks in timing life-history events. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of typical selection experiments, and how these limitations might be transcended in the future by a combination of more elaborate and realistic selection experiments, developmental evolutionary biology, and the emerging discipline of phenomics. }

The starting point is an immigration-and-death process for parasites within a host, as in [3]; it is assumed however that infections will normally occur with several larvae at the same time. Starting from here, a four-dimensional, where free-living larvae are explicitly considered, and a three-dimensional model are obtained with same methods used in [26]. The equilibria of these models are found, their stability is discussed, as well as some qualitative features. It has been found that the assumption of "clumped" infections may have dramatic effects on the aggregation exhibited by these models. Infections with several larvae at the same time also increases the stability of the endemic equilibria of these models, and makes the occurrence of subcritical bifurcations (and consequently multiple equilibria) slightly more likely. The results of the low-dimensional model have also been compared to numerical simulations of the infinite system that describes the immigration-and-death process. It appears that the results of the systems are, by and large, in close correspondence, except for a parameter region where the four-dimensional model exhibits unusual properties, such as the occurrence of multiple disease-free equilibria, that do not appear to be shared by the infinite system.}

At large research universities, students usually begin their study of genetics in large lecture classes. It is widely assumed that the lecture format, coupled with the pressures to be certain that students become familiar with the principles conclusions of genetics investigations, constrains most if not all departures from the formats textbooks used to explain these conclusions. Here I present several examples of mechanisms to introduce meaningful student inquiry in an introductory genetics course and to evaluate student creative effort. Most of the examples involve altered student preparation prior to class and additional in-class activities, while a few depend upon a smaller recitation section, which accompanies the course from which the examples have been drawn. I conclude that large introductory classes are suitable venues to teach students how to identify scientific claims, determine the evidence that is essential to eliminate alternative conclusions, and convince their peers of the validity of their arguments.}

Here we estimate the in vivo translational speeds of all sense codons from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Surprisingly, preferentially used codons are not translated faster than unpreferred ones. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is a result of codon usage in proportion to cognate tRNA concentrations, the optimal strategy in enhancing translational efficiency under tRNA shortage. Our predicted codon-tRNA balance is indeed observed from all model eukaryotes examined, and its impact on translational efficiency is further validated experimentally. Our study reveals a previously unsuspected mechanism by which unequal codon usage increases translational efficiency, demonstrates widespread natural selection for translational efficiency, and offers new strategies to improve synthetic biology.},

Bacillus subtilis, Sulfolobus tokodaii, and Thermotoga maritima) and two eukaryotic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster) genomes. We generated supersequences at each codon position across genes in a genome and computed the overall bias at each codon position. By quantitatively evaluating the trend of spatial patterns using isotonic regression, we show that in yeast and prokaryotic genomes, codon usage bias increases along translational direction, which is consistent with purifying selection against nonsense errors. Fruit fly genes show a nearly symmetric M-shaped spatial pattern of codon usage bias, with less bias ill the Middle and both ends. The low codon usage bias in the middle region is best explained by interference (the Hill-Robertson effect) between selections at different codon positions. In both yeast and fruit fly, spatial patterns of codon usage bias are characteristically different front patterns of GC-content variations. Effect of expression level on die strength of codon usage bias is more conspicuous than its effect on the shape of the spatial distribution. },

  Abstract                 = {Background and Methods: We examined the influence of viral load in relation to other risk factors for the heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In a community-based study of 15,127 persons in a rural district of Uganda, we identified 415 couples in which one partner was HIV-1-positive and one was initially HIV-1-negative and followed them prospectively for up to 30 months. The incidence of HIV-1 infection per 100 person-years among the initially seronegative partners was examined in relation to behavioral and biologic variables. Results: The male partner was HIV-1-positive in 228 couples, and the female partner was HIV-1-positive in 187 couples. Ninety of the 415 initially HIV-1-negative partners seroconverted (incidence, 11.8 per 100 person-years). The rate of male-to-female transmission was not significantly different from the rate of female-to-male transmission (12.0 per 100 person-years vs. 11.6 per 100 person-years). The incidence of seroconversion was highest among the partners who were 15 to 19 years of age (15.3 per 100 person-years). The incidence was 16.7 per 100 person-years among 137 uncircumcised male partners, whereas there were no seroconversions among the 50 circumcised male partners (P<0.001). The mean serum HIV-1 RNA level was significantly higher among HIV-1-positive subjects whose partners seroconverted than among those whose partners did not seroconvert (90,254 copies per milliliter vs. 38,029 copies per milliliter, P=0.01). There were no instances of transmission among the 51 subjects with serum HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 1500 copies per milliliter; there was a significant dose-response relation of increased transmission with increasing viral load. In multivariate analyses of log-transformed HIV-1 RNA levels, each log increment in the viral load was associated with a rate ratio of 2.45 for seroconversion (95 percent confidence interval, 1.85 to 3.26). Conclusions: The viral load is the chief predictor of the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV-1, and transmission is rare among persons with levels of less than 1500 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter.

The proportion of R. muscosa tadpole hosts that became infected increased with the number of previously infected R. muscosa tadpoles to which they were exposed, as would be expected in an infectious disease. 4. The laboratory experiment revealed some support for a transmission function in which the transmission rate levels off as the density of infected individuals increases. However, there was not enough power to distinguish between a frequency-dependent form and several other asymptotic forms of the transmission function. 5. The impacts of crowding and temperature on transmission were also investigated; however, neither of these factors significantly affected the transmission rate. },

An emerging infectious disease is one that has recently been discovered; has recently increased in incidence, geography, or host range; or is newly evolved. For any given outbreak of an emerging disease, it is therefore possible to state two hypotheses regarding its origin. The novel pathogen hypothesis states that the disease has recently spread into new geographic areas, whereas the endemic pathogen hypothesis suggests that it has been present in the environment but recently has increased in host range or pathogenicity. Distinguishing between these hypotheses is important, because the conservation measures needed to slow or stop the spread of a novel pathogen are likely to differ from those needed to prevent outbreaks of an endemic pathogen. Population genetics may help discriminate among the possible origins of an emerging disease. Current evidence suggests chytridiomycosis may be a novel pathogen being spread worldwide by carriers, until we know how much genetic variation to expect in an endemic strain, however, we cannot yet conclude that B. dendrobatidis is a novel pathogen. }

Consequently, the study of the genetic basis of adaptive evolutionary change has occupied biologists for decades, but progress has been hampered by the lack of resolution and the absence of a genome-level perspective. Technological advances in recent years should now allow us to answer many long-standing questions about the nature of adaptation. The data gathered so far are beginning to challenge some widespread views of the way in which natural selection operates at the genomic level. Papers in this Special Feature of Proceedings of the Royal Society B illustrate various aspects of the broad field of adaptation genomics. This introductory article sets up a context and, on the basis of a few selected examples, discusses how genomic data can advance our understanding of the process of adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: A large number of papers have been published on analysis of microarray data with particular emphasis on normalization of data, detection of differentially expressed genes, clustering of genes and regulatory network. On other hand there are only few studies on relation between expression level and composition of nucleotide/protein sequence, using expression data. There is a need to understand why particular genes/proteins express more in particular conditions. In this study, we analyze 3468 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae obtained from Holstege et al., ( 1998) to understand the relationship between expression level and amino acid composition. Results: We compute the correlation between expression of a gene and amino acid composition of its protein. It was observed that some residues ( like Ala, Gly, Arg and Val) have significant positive correlation ( r > 0.20) and some other residues ( Like Asp, Leu, Asn and Ser) have negative correlation ( r < - 0.15) with the expression of genes. A significant negative correlation ( r = - 0.18) was also found between length and gene expression. These observations indicate the relationship between percent composition and gene expression level. Thus, attempts have been made to develop a Support Vector Machine ( SVM) based method for predicting the expression level of genes from its protein sequence. In this method the SVM is trained with proteins whose gene expression data is known in a given condition. Then trained SVM is used to predict the gene expression of other proteins of the same organism in the same condition. A correlation coefficient r = 0.70 was obtained between predicted and experimentally determined expression of genes, which improves from r = 0.70 to 0.72 when dipeptide composition was used instead of residue composition. The method was evaluated using 5-fold cross validation test. We also demonstrate that amino acid composition information along with gene expression data can be used for improving the function classification of proteins. Conclusion: There is a correlation between gene expression and amino acid composition that can be used to predict the expression level of genes up to a certain extent. A web server based on the above strategy has been developed for calculating the correlation between amino acid composition and gene expression and prediction of expression level http:// kiwi. postech. ac. kr/ raghava/ lgepred/. This server will allow users to study the evolution from expression data.},

The risk factors associated with heterosexual transmission of HN-I are not well understood. To investigate the hypothesis that HIV-1 viral load may be related to heterosexual HIV-1 transmission, we measured HIV-1 RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in frozen samples from 39 men with hemophilia and HIV-1 infection obtained between 20 and 62 months after HIV-1 seroconversion? during at least a 6-month relationship with a female sexual partner. The median time from the hemophilic viral load determination to the estimated date of transmission to the female partner was 9 months (range, 4-41 months). The proportion of HIV-positive hemophilic men with >100,000 HN RNA copies/ml was significantly higher in transmitters (TR) (3 of 5 [60\%]), than in nontransmitters (NTR) (3 of 34 [9\%]; p = 0.027). There were no differences between TR and NTR in age at seroconversion (32.4 years each), in time from seroconversion to AIDS (67 versus 79 months), in mean CD4 number (245/mu l versus 260/mu l); nor in the proportion who developed AIDS (4 of 5 [80\%] versus 24 of 34 [71\%]), These findings appear to suggest that high HIV viral load in HIV-infected hemophilic men increases the risk of HIV transmission to heterosexual partners. Viral load determinations may be helpful in counseling hemophilic couples regarding transmission to female partners. }

Alternatively, downstream of a short upstream opew reading frame (uORF) in the 5' untranslated region of a gene, posttermination ribosomes can maintain the competence tw (re)initiate translation. Our data show that recycling anw reinitiation must be distinct processes in \emph{{S}accharomyces cerevisiae}. The role of the 3'UTR in recycling was assessed by restricting ribosome movement along the {mRNA} using a poly(G) stretch or the mammalian iron regulatory protein bound to the iron responsive element. We find that although 3'UTR structure can influence translation, the main pathway of ribosome recycling does not depend on scanning-like movement through the 3'UTR. Changes in termination kinetics or disruption of the Pab1-eIF4F interaction do not affect recycling, yet the maintenance of normal \emph{in vivo} mRNP structure is important to this process. Using bicistronic ACT1-LUC constructs, elongating yeast ribosomes were found to maintain the competence to (re)initiate over only short distances. Thus, as the first ORF to be translated is progressively truncated, reinitiation downstream of an uORF of 105 nt is found to be just detectable, and increases markedly in efficiency as uORF length is reduced to 15 nt. Experiments using a strain mutated in the Cca1 nucleotidyltransferase suggest that the uORF length-dependence of changes in reinitiation competence is affected by peptide elongation kinetics, but that ORF length per se may also be relevant. }

Instead, recent results show that workers are frequently coerced into acting altruistically. Hence, the altruism seen in many modern-day insect societies is not voluntary but enforced. Here, we also consider the role of coercion in promoting altruism and cooperation in other social systems, such as vertebrate and human societies, and interspecific mutualisms. },

Drug use practices vigorously advocated as resistance management tools by professional bodies, public health agencies, and medical schools represent some of humankind's largest attempts to manage evolution. It is our contention that these practices have poor theoretical and empirical justification for a broad spectrum of diseases. For instance, rapid elimination of pathogens can reduce the probability that de novo resistance mutations occur. This idea often motivates the medical orthodoxy that patients should complete drug courses even when they no longer feel sick. Yet "radical pathogen cure" maximizes the evolutionary advantage of any resistant pathogens that are present. It could promote the very evolution it is intended to retard. The guiding principle should be to impose no more selection than is absolutely necessary. We illustrate these arguments in the context of malaria; they likely apply to a wide range of infections as well as cancer and public health insecticides. Intuition is unreliable even in simple evolutionary contexts; in a social milieu where in-host competition can radically alter the fitness costs and benefits of resistance, expert opinion will be insufficient. An evidence-based approach to resistance management is required.},

Understanding the evolutionary response of diseases in new situations has clear public-health consequences, given the changes in social and movement patterns over recent decades and the increased use of antibiotics. This paper investigates how a disease may adapt in response to the routes of transmission available between infected and susceptible individuals. The potential transmission routes are defined by a computer-generated contact network, which we describe as either local (highly clustered networks where connected individuals are likely to share common contacts) or global (unclustered networks with a high proportion of long-range connections). Evolution towards stable strategies operates through the gradual random mutation of disease traits (transmission rate and infectious period) whenever new infections occur. In contrast to mean-field models, the use of contact networks greatly constrains the evolutionary dynamics. In the local networks, high transmission rates are selected for, as there is intense competition for susceptible hosts between disease progeny. By contrast, global networks select for moderate transmission rates because direct competition between progeny is minimal and a premium is placed upon persistence. All networks show a very slow but steady rise in the infectious period.}

The epitopes of these reagents are distinct but overlap substantially. One of these mAbs specifically blocks lymphokine release by T cells responsive to this complex but not others. We have used another to examine how the number of complexes on an APC is related to its ability to stimulate T cells.

Here mixed-integer linear programming was used to calculate and Study a subset of the alternate optimal solutions for a genome-scale metabolic model of \emph{Escherichia coli} (iJR904) under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Analysis of the calculated sets of optimal Solutions found that: (1) only a small subset of reactions in the network have variable fluxes across optima; (2) sets of reactions that are always used together in optimal solutions, correlated reaction sets, showed moderate agreement with the Currently known transcriptional regulatory structure in E. coli and available expression data, and (3) reactions that are used under certain environmental conditions call provide clues about network regulatory needs. In addition, calculation of Suboptimal flux distributions, using flux variability analysis, identified reactions which are used under significantly more environmental conditions suboptimally than optimally. Together these results demonstrate the utilization of reactions in genome-scale models under a variety of different growth conditions. }

To resolve this question, we developed a novel mathematical modeling scheme which allows us to incorporate measurements of virus load, target cells, and virus-specific immunity and applied it to a comprehensive data set generated in an experiment involving rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus. Half of the macaques studied were treated during the primary infection period with reagents which block T-cell costimulation and as a result displayed severely impaired virus-specific immune responses. Our results show that early viral replication in normal infection is controlled to a large extent by virus-specific CD8(+) T cells and not by target cell limitation.}

Although many of the molecular processes involved in viral attachment and entry have been resolved, the population dynamical mechanisms leading to the emergence of CXCR4-using HIV variants in some infected individuals are not yet understood. Here, we review various hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the change of HIV coreceptor usage in the course of infection, and conclude that any corroboration or rejection of these hypotheses requires a quantitative analysis of the interaction between the virus and immune cells. }

However, concentrating on single viral load measures during infection ignores valuable information contained during the entire replication history up to the onset of disease. We use a statistical model that allows all viral load data sampled during infection to be analysed, and have applied it to four immunocompromised groups exhibiting five distinct cytomegalovirus-related diseases. The results show that for all diseases, peaks in viral load contribute less to disease progression than phases of low virus load with equal amount of viral turnover. The model accurately predicted the time of disease onset for fever, gastrointestinal disease and pneumonitis but not for hepatitis and retinitis, implying that other factors may be involved in the pathology of these diseases. }

The saturation of viral replication dynamics observed in experimental systems can be explained in terms of heavy resource use by the virus. We then use our models to consider the conditions under which the growth of poliovirus is optimized. Intriguingly, if poliovirus has optimized its replication within cells, the predicted ratio of positive to negative strands is close to what is actually observed. We interpret our findings in terms of the evolution of life-history traits. }

However, many parasites have a broad range of host types they infect, and trade-offs between the parasite virulence in different host types may exist. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of host heterogeneity on the evolution of parasite virulence. By analyzing a simple model that describes the replication of different parasite strains in a population of two different host types, we determine the optimal level of virulence in both host types and find the conditions under which strains that specialize in one host type dominate the parasite population. Furthermore, we show that intrahost evolution of the parasite during an infection may lead to stable polymorphisms and could introduce evolutionary branching in the parasite population. }

Despite this complexity, in most cases only a single pharmacodynamic parameter, the MIC of the drug, is employed for the rational development of antibiotic treatment regimens. In this report, we use a mathematical model based on a Hill function-which we call the pharmacodynamic function and which is related to previously published E-max models-to describe the relationship between the bacterial net growth rates and the concentrations of antibiotics of five different classes: ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and rifampin. Using Escherichia coli 018:K1:H7, we illustrate how precise estimates of the four parameters of the pharmacodynamic function can be obtained from in vitro time-kill data. We show that, in addition to their respective MICs, these antibiotics differ in the values of the other pharmacodynamic parameters. Using a computer simulation of antibiotic treatment in vivo, we demonstrate that, as a consequence of differences in pharmacodynamic parameters, such as the steepness of the Hill function and the minimum bacterial net growth rate attained at high antibiotic concentrations, there can be profound differences in the microbiological efficacy of antibiotics with identical MICs. We discuss the clinical implications and limitations of these results.}

  Abstract                 = {Natural selection on codon usage is a pervasive force that acts on a large variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Despite this, obtaining reliable estimates of selection on codon usage has proved complicated, perhaps due to the fact that the selection coefficients involved are very small. In this work, a population genetics model is used to measure the strength of selected codon usage bias, S, in 10 eukaryotic genomes. It is shown that the strength of selection is closely linked to expression and that reliable estimates of selection coefficients can only be obtained for genes with very similar expression levels. We compare the strength of selected codon usage for orthologous genes across all 10 genomes classified according to expression categories. Fungi genomes present the largest S values (2.24-2.56), whereas multicellular invertebrate and plant genomes present more moderate values (0.61-1.91). The large mammalian genomes (human and mouse) show low S values (0.22-0.51) for the most highly expressed genes. This might not be evidence for selection in these organisms as the technique used here to estimate S does not properly account for nucleotide composition heterogeneity along such genomes. The relationship between estimated S values and empirical estimates of population size is presented here for the first time. It is shown, as theoretically expected, that population size has an important role in the operativity of translational selection. },

  Abstract                 = {\emph{Escherichia coli} has long been regarded as a model organism in the study of codon usage bias (CUB). However, most studies in this organism regarding this topic have been computational or, when experimental, restricted to small datasets; particularly poor attention has been given to genes with low CUB. In this work, correspondence analysis on codon usage is used to classify E.coli genes into three groups, and the relationship between them and expression levels from microarray experiments is studied. These groups are: group 1, highly biased genes; group 2, moderately biased genes; and group 3, AT-rich genes with low CUB. It is shown that, surprisingly, there is a negative correlation between codon bias and expression levels for group 3 genes, i.e. genes with extremely low codon adaptation index (CAI) values are highly expressed, while group 2 show the lowest average expression levels and group 1 show the usual expected positive correlation between CAI and expression. This trend is maintained over all functional gene groups, seeming to contradict the E.coli-yeast paradigm on CUB. It is argued that these findings are still compatible with the mutation-selection balance hypothesis of codon usage and that E.coli genes form a dynamic system shaped by these factors. },

We present a model that describes the coevolution of host and parasite, assuming that the rate of transmission or the virulence depends on both genotypes. The evolution of these traits is constrained by trade-offs that account for costs of defense and attack strategies, in line with previous studies on the separate evolution of the host and the parasite. Considering shared control by the host and the parasite in determining the traits of the relationship leads to several novel predictions. First, the host should evolve maximal investment in defense against parasites with an intermediate replication rate. Second, the evolution of the parasite strongly depends on the way the host's defense is described. Third, the coevolutionary process may lead to decreasing the parasite's virulence as a response to a rise in the host's background mortality, contrary to classical predictions. }

  Abstract                 = {Protein synthesis has an overall error rate of approximately 10(-4) for each mRNA codon translated. The fidelity of translation is mainly determined by two events: synthesis of cognate amino acid: tRNA pairs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and accurate selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) by the ribosome. To ensure faithful aa-tRNA synthesis, many aaRSs employ a proofreading ("editing") activity, such as phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS) that hydrolyze mischarged Tyr-tRNA(Phe). Eukaryotes maintain two distinct PheRS enzymes, a cytoplasmic (ctPheRS) and an organellar form. CtPheRS is similar to bacterial enzymes in that it consists of a heterotetramer in which the alpha-subunits contain the active site and the beta-subunits harbor the editing site. In contrast, mitochondrial PheRS (mtPheRS) is an alpha-subunit monomer that does not edit Tyr-tRNA(Phe), and a comparable transacting activity does not exist in organelles. Although mtPheRS does not edit, it is extremely specific as only one Tyr-tRNA(Phe) is synthesized for every similar to 7; 300 Phe-tRNA(Phe), compatible with an error rate in translation of similar to 10(-4). When the error rate of mtPheRS was increased 17-fold, the corresponding strain could not grow on respiratory media and the mitochondrial genome was rapidly lost. In contrast, error-prone mtPheRS, editing-deficient ctPheRS, and their wildtype counterparts all supported cytoplasmic protein synthesis and cell growth. These striking differences reveal unexpectedly divergent requirements for quality control in different cell compartments and suggest that the limits of translational accuracy may be largely determined by cellular physiology. },

  Abstract                 = {SETTING: Many epidemiologic studies of tuberculosis are being conducted worldwide. Fingerprinting with a secondary marker in strains with fewer than six IS6110-hybridizing bands enhances the tracking of strains, but its impact on population-level inferences has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of secondary genotyping for low-copy Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with polymorphic guanine-cytosine-rich repetitive sequence (PGRS) on epidemiologic inferences in population-based research settings. DESIGN: For San Francisco tuberculosis cases (1991-1996), clusters were defined by IS6110 alone and by PGRSlIS6110 to 1) estimate recent transmission, 2) evaluate the theoretical influence of bacterial population parameters on these estimates, and 3) assess risk factors for recent transmission. RESULTS: Secondary typing on low-copy strains (20.3\% of all isolates) decreased the estimate of recent transmission from 29.1\% to 25.3\% (P = 0.03). The most influential parameters in determining whether supplemental genotyping results in different estimates were the proportion of low-copy strains and the amount of clustering. Risk factors for recent transmission were identical for both definitions of clustering. CONCLUSION: The statistical and inferred effects of sec ondary genotyping of M. tuberculosis seem to depend on the proportion of low-copy strains in the population, When this proportion is low or when few secondary patterns match, supplemental genotyping may yield minimal insight into population-level investigations. }

A comparative annotation of these genomes identified a near extinction of transposons and the associated innovation of transposon-free centromeres. Expression analysis established that meiotic genes are subject to antisense transcription during vegetative growth, which suggests a mechanism for their tight regulation. In addition, trans-acting regulators control new genes within the context of expanded functional modules for meiosis and stress response. Differences in gene content and regulation also explain why, unlike the budding yeast of Saccharomycotina, fission yeasts cannot use ethanol as a primary carbon source. These analyses elucidate the genome structure and gene regulation of fission yeast and provide tools for investigation across the Schizosaccharomyces clade. },

  Abstract                 = { Evolution can change the developmental processes underlying a character without changing the average expression of the character itself. This sort of change must occur in both the evolution of canalization, in which a character becomes increasingly buffered against genetic or developmental variation, and in the phenomenon of closely related species that show similar adult phenotypes but different underlying developmental patterns. To study such phenomena, I develop a model that follows evolution on a surface representing adult phenotype as a function of underlying developmental characters. A contour on such a "phenotype landscape" is a set of states of developmental characters that produce the same adult phenotype. Epistasis induces curvature of this surface, and degree of canalization is represented by the slope along a contour. I first discuss the geometric properties of phenotype landscapes, relating epistasis to canalization. I then impose a fitness function on the phenotype and model evolution of developmental characters as a function of the fitness function and the local geometry of the surface. This model shows how canalization evolves as a population approaches an optimum phenotype. It further shows that under some circumstances, "decanalization" can occur, in which the expression of adult phenotype becomes increasingly sensitive to developmental variation. This process can cause very similar populations to diverge from one another developmentally even when their adult phenotypes experience identical selection regimes.}

Model selection can also be used to compare mechanistic models derived from ecological theory, thereby providing a formal framework for testing the theory. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is the most commonly adopted criterion used to compare models; however, its performance in general is not very well known. The best model according to AIC has the smallest expected Kullback-Leibler (K-L) distance, which is an information-theoretic measure of the difference between a model and the truth. I review the theory behind AIC and demonstrate how it can be used to test ecological theory by considering two example studies of foraging, motivated by simple foraging theory. I present plausible truths for the two studies, and models that can be fit to the foraging data. K-L distances are calculated for simulated studies, which provide an appropriate test of AIC. Results support the use of a commonly adopted rule of thumb for selecting models based on AIC differences. However, AIC(c), a corrected version of AIC commonly used to reduce model selection bias, showed no clear improvement, and model averaging, a technique to reduce model prediction bias, gave mixed results.}

The resource is distributed in a patchy but homogeneous environment; that is, all patches are intrinsically identical. The two consumer species are referred to as diggers and grazers, where diggers deplete the resource within a patch to lower densities than grazers. We show that the two distinct feeding strategies can produce a heterogeneous resource distribution that enables their coexistence. Coexistence requires that grazers must either move faster than diggers between patches or convert the resources to population growth much more efficiently than diggers. The model shows that the functional form of resource renewal within a patch is also important for coexistence. These results contrast with theory that considers exploitation competition for a single resource when the resource is assumed to be well mixed throughout the system.},

This interaction results in activation of cognate T cells, expansion of that T cell lineage and their exit from the LN T-zone via efferent lymphatics (ELs). How antigenspecific T cells locate DCs within this complex environment is controversial, and both random T cell migration and chernotaxis have been proposed. We developed an agent-based computational model of a LN that captures many features of T cell and DC dynamics observed by two-photon microscopy. Our simulations matched in vivo two-photon microscopy data regarding T cell speed, short-term directional persistence of motion and cell motility. We also obtained in vivo data regarding density of T cells and DCs within a LN and matched our model environment to measurements of the distance from HEVs to ELs. We used our model to compare chernotaxis with random motion and showed that chernotaxis increased total number of T cell DC contacts, but decreased unique contacts, producing fewer activated T cells. Our results suggest that, within a LN T-zone, a random search strategy is optimal for a rare cognate T cell to find its DC match and maximize production of activated T cells. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we report on the development of a kinetic mathematical model that accurately simulates the developmental patterns of monoterpenoid essential oil accumulation in peppermint (Mentha x piperita). This model was then used to evaluate the biochemical processes underlying experimentally determined changes in the monoterpene pathway under low ambient-light intensities, which led to an accumulation of the branchpoint intermediate (+)-pulegone and the side product (+)-menthofuran. Our simulations indicated that the environmentally regulated changes in monoterpene profiles could only be explained when, in addition to effects on biosynthetic enzyme activities, as yet unidentified inhibitory effects of (+)-menthofuran on the branchpoint enzyme pulegone reductase (PR) were assumed. Subsequent in vitro analyses with recombinant protein confirmed that (+)-menthofuran acts as a weak competitive inhibitor of PR (K(i) = 300 muM). To evaluate whether the intracellular concentration of (+)-menthofuran was high enough for PR inhibition in vivo, we isolated essential oil-synthesizing secretory cells from peppermint leaves and subjected them to steam distillations. When peppermint plants were grown under low-light conditions, (+)-menthofuran was selectively retained in secretory cells and accumulated to very high levels (up to 20 mM), whereas under regular growth conditions, (+)-menthofuran levels remained very low (<400 muM). These results illustrate the utility of iterative cycles of mathematical modeling and experimental testing to elucidate the mechanisms controlling flux through metabolic pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {Local protein interactions ("molecular context" effects) dictate amino acid replacements and can be described in terms of site-specific, energetic preferences for any different amino acid. It has been recently debated whether these preferences remain approximately constant during evolution or whether, due to coevolution of sites, they change strongly. Such research highlights an unresolved and fundamental issue with far-reaching implications for phylogenetic analysis and molecular evolution modeling. Here, we take advantage of the recent availability of phenotypically supported laboratory resurrections of Precambrian thioredoxins and beta-lactamases to experimentally address the change of site-specific amino acid preferences over long geological timescales. Extensive mutational analyses support the notion that evolutionary adjustment to a new amino acid may occur, but to a large extent this is insufficient to erase the primitive preference for amino acid replacements. Generally, site-specific amino acid preferences appear to remain conserved throughout evolutionary history despite local sequence divergence. We show such preference conservation to be readily understandable in molecular terms and we provide crystallographic evidence for an intriguing structural-switch mechanism: Energetic preference for an ancestral amino acid in a modern protein can be linked to reorganization upon mutation to the ancestral local structure around the mutated site. Finally, we point out that site-specific preference conservation naturally leads to one plausible evolutionary explanation for the existence of intragenic global suppressor mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose and analyse a model for the dynamics of directly transmitted nematode infections of ruminants which allows for the long-term effects of the annual removal of hosts. The model is a simple continuous-time formulation which captures the principal features of parasite transmission and the acquisition of immunity to infection by the host. Analysis of the simplest version of the model, which assumes a constant host population through time, indicates that its equilibrium is locally stable for feasible biological parameters. The regular removal of hosts involved in most management strategies is modelled in terms of periodic perturbations. The analysis indicates that the periodic removal of parasitized hosts corresponds effectively to a reduction in the basic reproductive rate of infection. We also demonstrate that the system exhibits a dramatic peak in parasite numbers during each grazing season at its dynamic equilibrium. This phenomenon (which is characteristically observed in real systems) is discussed in terms of the balance between acquired immunity and periodic perturbations of the parasite population. }

This paper examines the expected proportions of genotype frequencies after adjusting the Hardy-Weinberg model for close inbreeding avoidance in an inbred population. This corrected model was used to evaluate genotype distributions for HLA haplotypes and haplotypes created from three microsatellite loci on human chromosome 13 in a sample of 315 married Hutterites. In this sample, there were five individuals who were homozygous for an HLA haplotype and 15 individuals who were homozygous for a chromosome 13 haplotype. The expected numbers of homozygotes were 21 for HLA and 26 for chromosome 13 haplotypes using a model adjusted for overall inbreeding (P = 0.00031 for HLA and P = 0.019 for chromosome 13) and 18 for HLA and 22 chromosome 13 haplotypes using a model adjusted for both overall inbreeding and close inbreeding avoidance (P = 0.0016 for HLA and P = 0.099 for chromosome 13). The model that takes into account both overall inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance provided a better fit to the observed genotype distributions for chromosome 13 haplotypes (P = 0.099), suggesting that nonrandom aspects of Hutterire mating structure, other than inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance, have small effects on genotype distributions in the population. The fact that significant deficiencies of HLA homozygotes persist after taking into account inbreeding avoidance further suggests that factors related to the HLA haplotype per se influence the genotype proportions at HLA loci in the Hutterites.

With this comparatively realistic framework, an evolutionary rate at a site can depend both on the state of the site and on the states of surrounding sites. By allowing a relatively general dependence structure among sites, models of evolution can reflect attributes of tertiary structure. To quantify the impact of protein structure on protein evolution, we analyze protein-coding DNA sequence pairs with an evolutionary model that incorporates effects of solvent accessibility and pairwise interactions among amino acid residues. By explicitly considering the relationship between nonsynonymous substitution rates and protein structure, this approach can lead to refined detection and characterization of positive selection. Analyses of simulated sequence pairs indicate that parameters in this evolutionary model can be well estimated. Analyses of lysozyme c and annexin V sequence pairs yield the biologically reasonable result that amino acid replacement rates are higher when the replacements lead to energetically favorable proteins than when they destabilize the proteins. Although the focus here is evolutionary dependence among codons that is associated with protein structure, the statistical approach is quite general and could be applied to diverse cases of evolutionary dependence where surrogates for sequence fitness can be measured or modeled.},

  Abstract                 = {The selection-mutation-drift theory of codon usage plays a major role in the theory of molecular evolution by explaining the co-evolution of codon usage bias and {tRNA} content in the framework of translation optimization. Because most Studies have focused only on codon usage, we analyzed the {tRNA} gene pool of 102 bacterial species. We show that as minimal generation times get shorter, the genomes contain more {tRNA} genes, but fewer anticodon species. Surprisingly, despite the wide G+C variation of bacterial genomes these anticodons are the same in most genomes. This suggests an optimization of the translation machinery to use a small subset of optimal coclons and anticodons in fast-growing bacteria and in highly expressed genes. As a result, the overrepresented codons in highly expressed genes tend to be the same in very different genomes to match the same most-frequent anticodons. This is particularly important in fast-growing bacteria, which have higher codon usage bias in these genes. Three models were tested to understand the choice of coclons recognized by the same anticodons, all providing significant fit, but under different classes of genes and genomes. Thus, co-evolution of {tRNA} gene composition and codon usage bias in genomes seen from {tRNA}'s point of view agrees with the selection-mutation-drift theory. However, it Suggests a Much more universal trend in the evolution of anticodon and codon choice than previously thought. It also provides new evidence that a selective force for the optimization of the translation machinery is the maximization of growth. },

The randomized genetic perturbations affect traits directly and indirectly, and the similarities and differences between traits in their responses to common perturbations allow inferences about whether variation in a trait is a cause of a phenotype (such as disease) or whether the trait variation is, instead, an effect of that phenotype. It is then possible to use this information about causes and effects to build models of probabilistic 'causal networks'.

In part, discrimination results from different rejection rates that are due to different stabilities of the respective codon-anticodon complexes. An important additional contribution is provided by induced fit, in that only correct codon recognition leads to acceleration of rate-limiting rearrangements that precede chemical steps. Recent elucidation of ribosome structures and mutational analyses suggest which residues of the decoding center may be involved in signaling formation of the correct codon-anticodon duplex to the functional centers of the ribosome. In utilizing induced fit for substrate discrimination, the ribosome resembles other nucleic acid-programmed polymerases.},

Here, it is emphasized that while the first approach directly enjoys the statistical guaranties of traditional likelihood theory, the latter does not, and should be approached with particular caution when the site-specific variables are high dimensional.

Assuming that sites evolve independently greatly simplifies the required calculations. However, this simplification is known to be incorrect in many cases. Here, a computational method that allows for general dependence between sites of a sequence is investigated. Using this method, measures acting as sequence fitness proxies can be considered over a phylogenetic tree. In this work, a set of statistically derived amino acid pairwise potentials, developed in the context of protein threading, is used to account for what we call the structural fitness of a sequence. We describe a model combining statistical potentials with an empirical amino acid substitution matrix. We propose such a combination as a useful way of capturing the complexity of protein evolution.

Several variations and extensions to their models have since been proposed, but no general and flexible framework for contrasting the relative performance of alternative approaches has yet been applied. Here, we compute Bayes factors to evaluate the relative merit of several MG and GY styles of codon substitution models, including recent extensions acknowledging heterogeneous nonsynonymous rates across sites, as well as selective effects inducing uneven amino acid or codon preferences. Our results on three real data sets support a logical model construction following the MG formulation, allowing for a flexible account of global amino acid or codon preferences, while maintaining distinct parameters governing overall nucleotide propensities. Through posterior predictive checks, we highlight the importance of such a parameterization. Altogether, the framework presented here suggests a broad modeling project in the MG style, stressing the importance of combining and contrasting available model formulations and grounding developments in a sound probabilistic paradigm.},

To systematically investigate the degree of incongruence, and potential methods for resolving it, we screened the genome sequences of eight yeast species and selected 106 widely distributed orthologous genes for phylogenetic analyses, singly and by concatenation. Our results suggest that data sets consisting of single or a small number of concatenated genes have a significant probability of supporting conflicting topologies. By contrast, analyses of the entire data set of concatenated genes yielded a single, fully resolved species tree with maximum support. Comparable results were obtained with a concatenation of a minimum of 20 genes; substantially more genes than commonly used but a small fraction of any genome. These results have important implications for resolving branches of the tree of life.},

  Abstract                 = {During an infection, malaria parasites compete for limited amounts of food and enemy-free space. Competition affects parasite growth rate, transmission and virulence, and is thus important for parasite evolution. Much evolutionary theory assumes that virulent clones outgrow avirulent ones, favouring the evolution of higher virulence. We infected laboratory mice with a mixture of two Plasmodium chabaudi clones: one virulent, the other avirulent. Using real-time quantitative PCR to track the two parasite clones over the course of the infection, we found that the virulent clone overgrew the avirulent clone. However, host genotype had a major effect on the outcome of competition. In a relatively resistant mouse genotype (C57B1/6J), the avirulent clone was suppressed below detectable levels after 10 days, and apparently lost from the infection. By contrast, in more susceptible mice (CBA/Ca), the avirulent clone was initially suppressed, but it persisted, and during the chronic phase of infection it did better than it did in single infections. Thus, the qualitative outcome of competition depended on host genotype. We suggest that these differences may be explained by different immune responses in the two mouse strains. Host genotype and resistance could therefore play a key role in the outcome of within-host competition between parasite clones and in the evolution of parasite virulence. }

We found that the stabilization yielded by aggregation depends strongly on the mechanism producing the aggregation: multiple infections are much less stabilizing than when aggregation is assumed to be fixed from the outside, while the opposite holds for host heterogeneity. We also give analytical estimates of the period of oscillations occurring when the equilibrium is unstable. Finally, we explore in these models the role of aggregation in host regulation and in determining a threshold value for parasite establishment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

  Abstract                 = {In infectious disease epidemiology, it is useful to know how quickly genetic markers of pathogenic agents evolve while inside hosts. We propose a modular framework with which these genotype change rates can be estimated. The estimation scheme requires a model of the underlying process of genetic change, a detection scheme that filters this process into observable quantities, and a monitoring scheme that describes the timing of observations. We study a linear "birth-shift-death" model for change in transposable element genotypes, obtaining maximum-likelihood estimators for various detection and monitoring schemes. The method is applied to serial genotypes of the transposon IS6110 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The estimated birth rate of 0.0161 (events per copy of the transposon per year) and death rate of 0.0108 are both significantly larger than the estimated shift rate of 0.0018. The sum of these estimates, which corresponds to a "half-life" of 2.4 years for a typical strain that has 10 copies of the element, substantially exceeds a previous estimate of 0.0135 total changes per copy per year. We consider experimental design issues that enable the precision of estimates to be improved. We also discuss extensions to other markers and implications for molecular epidemiology.

With the 2-fold aim of addressing this problem and clarifying pancrustacean relationships, we explored the signals in the 62 protein-coding genes carefully assembled by Regier et al. in 2010. With reference to the pancrustaceans, this data set infers a highly supported nucleotide tree that is substantially different to the corresponding, but poorly supported, amino acid one. We show that the discrepancy between the nucleotide-based and the amino acids-based trees is caused by substitutions within synonymous codon families (especially those of serine-TCN and AGY). We show that different arthropod lineages are differentially biased in their usage of serine, arginine, and leucine synonymous codons, and that the serine bias is correlated with the topology derived from the nucleotides, but not the amino acids. We suggest that a parallel, partially compositionally driven, synonymous codon-usage bias affects the nucleotide topology. As substitutions between serine codon families can proceed through threonine or cysteine intermediates, amino acid data sets might also be affected by the serine codon-usage bias. We suggest that a Dayhoff recoding strategy would partially ameliorate the effects of such bias. Although amino acids provide an alternative hypothesis of pancrustacean relationships, neither the nucleotides nor the amino acids version of this data set seems to bring enough genuine phylogenetic information to robustly resolve the relationships within group, which should still be considered unresolved.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The standard genetic code translates 61 codons into 20 amino acids using fewer than 61 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). This is possible because of the tRNA's ability to 'wobble' at the third base to decode more than one codon. Although the anticodon-codon mapping of tRNA to mRNA is a prerequisite for certain codon usage indices and can contribute to the understanding of the evolution of alternative genetic codes, it is usually not determined experimentally because such assays are prohibitively expensive and elaborate. Instead, the codon reading is approximated from theoretical inferences of nucleotide binding, the wobble rules. Unfortunately, these rules fail to capture all of the nuances of codon reading. This study addresses the codon reading properties of tRNAs and their evolutionary impact on codon usage bias. Results: Using three different computational methods, the signal of tRNA decoding in codon usage bias is identified. The predictions by the methods generally agree with each other and compare well with experimental evidence of codon reading. This analysis suggests a revised codon reading for cytosolic tRNA in the yeast genome (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that is more accurate than the common assignment by wobble rules. The results confirm the earlier observation that the wobble rules are not sufficient for a complete description of codon reading, because they depend on genome-specific factors. The computational methods presented here are applicable to any fully sequenced genome.},

Here, gene duplication is examined across levels of biological organization in an attempt to create a unified picture of the mechanistic process by which gene duplication can have played a role in generating biodiversity. Neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization have been proposed as important processes driving the retention of duplicate genes. These models have foundations in population genetic theory, which is now being refined by explicit consideration of the structural constraints placed upon genes encoding proteins through physical chemistry. Further, such models can be examined in the context of comparative genomics, where an integration of gene-level evolution and species-level evolution allows an assessment of the frequency of duplication and the fate of duplicate genes. This process, of course, is dependent upon the biochemical role that duplicated genes play in biological systems, which is in turn dependent upon the mechanism of duplication: whole genome duplication involving a co-duplication of interacting partners vs. single gene duplication. Lastly, the role that these processes may have played in driving speciation is examined. },

Galactose-response data yielded the known binding site of Gal4, and six of nine genes known to be induced by galactose. Heat shock data yielded the cell-cycle activation motif, which is known to mediate cell-cycle dependent activation, and a set of genes coding for all four nucleosomal proteins.

  Abstract                 = {Background: Model violations constitute the major limitation in inferring accurate phylogenies. Characterizing properties of the data that are not being correctly handled by current models is therefore of prime importance. One of the properties of protein evolution is the variation of the relative rate of substitutions across sites and over time, the latter is the phenomenon called heterotachy. Its effect on phylogenetic inference has recently obtained considerable attention, which led to the development of new models of sequence evolution. However, thus far focus has been on the quantitative heterogeneity of the evolutionary process, thereby overlooking more qualitative variations. Results: We studied the importance of variation of the site-specific amino-acid substitution process over time and its possible impact on phylogenetic inference. We used the CAT model to define an infinite mixture of substitution processes characterized by equilibrium frequencies over the twenty amino acids, a useful proxy for qualitatively estimating the evolutionary process. Using two large datasets, we show that qualitative changes in site-specific substitution properties over time occurred significantly. To test whether this unaccounted qualitative variation can lead to an erroneous phylogenetic tree, we analyzed a concatenation of mitochondrial proteins in which Cnidaria and Porifera were erroneously grouped. The progressive removal of the sites with the most heterogeneous CAT profiles across clades led to the recovery of the monophyly of Eumetazoa (Cnidaria+Bilateria), suggesting that this heterogeneity can negatively influence phylogenetic inference. Conclusion: The time-heterogeneity of the amino-acid replacement process is therefore an important evolutionary aspect that should be incorporated in future models of sequence change.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an expression measure of a gene, devised to predict the level of gene expression from relative codon bias (RCB). There are a number of measures currently in use that quantify codon usage in genes. Based on the hypothesis that gene expressivity and codon composition is strongly correlated, RCB has been defined to provide an intuitively meaningful measure of an extent of the codon preference in a gene. We outline a simple approach to assess the strength of RCB (RCBS) in genes as a guide to their likely expression levels and illustrate this with an analysis of Escherichia coli (E. coli) genome. Our efforts to quantitatively predict gene expression levels in E. coli met with a high level of success. Surprisingly, we observe a strong correlation between RCBS and protein length indicating natural selection in favour of the shorter genes to be expressed at higher level. The agreement of our result with high protein abundances, microarray data and radioactive data demonstrates that the genomic expression profile available in our method can be applied in a meaningful way to the study of cell physiology and also for more detailed studies of particular genes of interest. },

  Abstract                 = {A high level of accuracy during protein synthesis is considered essential for life. Aminoacyl-{tRNA} synthetases (aaRSs) translate the genetic code by ensuring the correct pairing of amino acids with their cognate {tRNA}s. Because some aaRSs also produce misacylated aminoacyl-{tRNA} (aa-{tRNA}) \emph{in vivo}, we addressed the question of protein quality within the context of missense suppression by Cys-{tRNA}(Pro), Ser-{tRNA}(Thr), Glu-{tRNA}(Gln), and Asp-{tRNA}(Asn). Suppression of an active-site missense mutation leads to a mixture of inactive mutant protein (from translation with correctly acylated aa-{tRNA}) and active enzyme indistinguishable from the wild-type protein (from translation with misacylated aa-{tRNA}). Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that under selective pressure, \emph{Escherichia coli} not only tolerates the presence of misacylated aa-{tRNA}, but can even require it for growth. Furthermore, by using mass spectrometry of a reporter protein not subject to selection, we show that E. coli can survive the ambiguous genetic code imposed by misacylated aa-{tRNA} tolerating up to 10\% of mismade protein. The editing function of aaRSs to hydrolyze misacylated aa-{tRNA} is not essential for survival, and the EF-Tu barrier against misacylated aa-{tRNA} is not absolute. Rather, E. coli copes with mistranslation by triggering the heat shock response that stimulates nonoptimized polypeptides to achieve a native conformation or to be degraded. In this way, E. coli ensures the presence of sufficient functional protein albeit at a considerable energetic cost.},

  Abstract                 = {The misconstruction of proteins as a result of the displacement of one of more proline residues by their congener, azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Aze), can result in various disorders. A number of lines of evidence suggest that multiple sclerosis may be among these. This concept adheres to the current view that multiple sclerosis lesions originate in the myelin sheath and that the underlying molecular abnormality involves the myelin basic protein. The Aze hypothesis posits that myelin basic protein and possibly other closely related molecules are misassembled in sites of lesion formation because of the substitution of Aze for one or more prolines within consensual epitopes. These include a highly conserved myelin basic protein hexapeptide sequence, PRTPPP, and an alpha helix bounded by prolyls. Recent studies have focused on the immunopathogenetic effects of posttranslational modification of this region. This hypothesis proposes that the domain is structurally, functionally, and antigenically altered by the intrusion of Aze in place of proline and that such misassembly may involve other proteins and adversely affect interactions with neighboring molecules. This report reviews evidence supporting the hypothesis that ingestion of Aze in the diet, in conjunction with genetic susceptibility, may predispose or contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Rumen microbiologists are beginning to use genetic engineering techniques, and researchers should carefully consider both the potentials and limitations of using this technology to manipulate the rumen microbial ecosystem. Despite encouraging rhetoric, it is difficult to identify specific examples where genetic engineering would enhance ruminal performance. Many practical problems (lactic acidosis, deamination, etc.) might be better served by genetic engineering approaches that delete rather than add genes. The difficulty with this approach is that a highly selective means of preventing wild types from recolonizing the rumen would be needed. The addition of specific genes is confounded by 1) the fact that the rumen microorganisms are already adapted to the rumen, 2) the diversity of species inhabiting the rumen and 3) the complexity of interactions among these species. Aspects such as increased rates of cellulose digestion and changes in amino acid composition of the microflora are particularly sensitive to these biological constraints. Genetic engineering has, however, the potential to alleviate new limitations that humans have imposed on the rumen (detoxification, resistance to low pH, the digestion of novel feed materials, etc). A particular strategy of moving acid-resistant cellulose genes into noncellulytic, but acid-resistant, rumen bacteria is described.},

We report here that when Drosophila Hsp90 is mutant or pharmacologically impaired, phenotypic variation affecting nearly any adult structure is produced, with specific variants depending on the genetic background and occurring both in laboratory strains and in wild populations. Multiple, previously silent, genetic determinants produced these variants and, when enriched by selection, they rapidly became independent of the Hsp90 mutation. Therefore, widespread variation affecting morphogenic pathways exists in nature, but is usually silent; Hsp90 buffers this variation, allowing it to accumulate under neutral conditions. When Hsp90 buffering is compromised, for example by temperature, cryptic variants are expressed and selection can lead to the continued expression of these traits, even when Hsp90 function is restored. This provides a plausible mechanism for promoting evolutionary change in otherwise entrenched developmental processes.},

Our exact solutions also revise the known results of neutral networks in quasispecies theory.

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Darwin recognized that natural selection could not favor a trait in one species solely for the benefit of another species. The modern, selfish 'gene view of the world suggests that cooperation between individuals, whether of the same species or different species, should be especially vulnerable to the evolution of noncooperators. Yet, cooperation is prevalent in nature both within and between species. What special circumstances or mechanisms thus favor cooperation? Currently, evolutionary biology offers a set of disparate explanations, and a general framework for this breadth of models has not emerged. Here, we offer a tripartite structure that links previously disconnected views of cooperation. We distinguish three general models by which cooperation can evolve and be maintained: (i) directed reciprocation 'cooperation with individuals who give in return; (ii) shared genes 'cooperation with relatives (e.g., kin selection); and (iii) byproduct benefits 'cooperation as an incidental consequence of selfish action. Each general model is further subdivided. Several renowned examples of cooperation that have lacked explanation until recently 'plant 'rhizobium symbioses and bacteria 'squid light organs 'fit squarely within this framework. Natural systems of cooperation often involve more than one model, and a fruitful direction for future research is to understand how these models interact to maintain cooperation in the long term. },

  Abstract                 = {Parasitic protozoa are a major cause of global infectious disease. These eukaryotic pathogens have evolved with the vertebrate immune system and typically produce long-lasting chronic infections. A critical step in their host interaction is the evasion of innate immune defenses. The ability to avoid attack by humoral effector mechanisms, such as complement lysis, is of particular importance to extracellular parasites, whereas intracellular protozoa must resist killing by lysosomal enzymes and toxic metabolites. They do so by remodeling the phagosomal compartments in which they reside and by interfering with signaling pathways that lead to cellular activation. In addition, there is growing evidence that protozoan pathogens modify the antigen-presenting and immunoregulatory functions of dendritic cells, a process that facilitates their evasion of both innate and adaptive immunity.},

However, experimental data on protein interactions contain many false positives, making these discoveries difficult. Therefore computational methods of assessing the reliability of each candidate protein-protein interaction are urgently needed. Results: We developed a new 'interaction generality' measure (IG2) to assess the reliability of protein-protein interactions using only the topological properties of their interaction-network structure. Using yeast protein-protein interaction data, we showed that reliable protein-protein interactions had significantly lower IG2 values than less-reliable interactions, suggesting that IG2 values can be used to evaluate and filter interaction data to enable the construction of reliable protein-protein interaction networks.},

  Abstract                 = {The suppression of stop codons (termed translational readthrough) can be caused by a decreased accuracy of translation elongation or a reduced efficiency of translation termination. In previous studies, the inability to determine the extent to which each of these distinct processes contributes to a readthrough phenotype has limited our ability to evaluate how defects in the translational machinery influence the overall termination process. Here, we describe the combined use of misincorporation and readthrough reporter systems to determine which of these mechanisms contributes to translational readthrough in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The misincorporation reporter system was generated by introducing a series of near-cognate mutations into functionally important residues in the firefly luciferase gene. These constructs allowed us to monitor the incidence of elongation errors by monitoring the level of firefly luciferase activity from a mutant allele inactivated by a single missense mutation. In this system, an increase in luciferase activity should reflect an increased level of misincorporation of the wild-type amino acid that provides an estimate of the overall fidelity of translation elongation. Surprisingly, we found that growth in the presence of paromomycin stimulated luciferase activity for only a small subset of the mutant proteins examined. This suggests that the ability of this aminoglycoside to induce elongation errors is limited to a subset of near-cognate mismatches. We also found that a similar bias in near-cognate misreading could be induced by the expression of a mutant form of ribosomal protein (r-protein) S9B or by depletion of r-protein L12. We used this misincorporation reporter in conjunction with a readthrough reporter system to show that alterations at different regions of the ribosome influence elongation fidelity and termination efficiency to different extents.},

We also studied how these trends change along the length of the genes and in a subset of highly expressed genes. Our results corroborate some of the trends previously described in Tetrahymena, but also negate some specific observations. In both genomes we found a strong bias toward codons with low GC content; however, in highly expressed genes this bias is smaller and codons ending in GC tend to be more frequent. We also found that codon bias increases along gene segments and in highly expressed genes and that the context surrounding initiation and termination codons are always AT rich. Our results also suggest differences in the efficiency of translation of the reassigned stop codons between the two species and between the reassigned codons. Finally, we discuss some of the possible causes for such translational efficiency differences. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved. },

These features are indicative of carrier mediated transport and suggest that a P. falciparum-encoded protein facilitates chloroquine import. Although both chloroquine-resistant and susceptible parasite isolates exhibit facilitated chloroquine uptake, the kinetics differ. Chloroquine-resistant parasite isolates consistently have an import mechanism with a lower transport activity and a reduced affinity for chloroquine. These differences in uptake kinetics are linked with chloroquine resistance in a genetic cross. These data suggest that changes in chloroquine import kinetics constitute a minimal and necessary event in the generation of the resistant phenotype. Competitive inhibition of chloroquine uptake by amiloride derivatives further suggests that chloroquine import is mediated by a plasmodial Na+/H+ exchanger. }

Model parameters are estimated from available experimental data. The model is shown to have a single stable steady state for these estimated parameter values, and this steady state corresponds to the lysogenic state. When the CI degradation rate (gamma(cl)) is slightly increased from its normal value (gamma(cl) similar or equal to 0.0 min(-1)), two additional steady states appear ( through a saddle-node bifurcation) in addition to the lysogenic state. One of these new steady states is stable and corresponds to the lytic state. The other steady state is an ( unstable) saddle node. The coexistence these two globally stable steady states ( the lytic and lysogenic states) is maintained with further increases of gamma(cl) until gamma(cl) similar or equal to 0.35 min(-1), when the lysogenic steady state and the saddle node collide and vanish ( through a reverse saddle node bifurcation) leaving only the lytic state surviving. These results allow us to understand the high degree of stability of the lysogenic state because, normally, it is the only steady state. Further implications of these results for the stability of the phage lambda switch are discussed, as well as possible experimental tests of the model. },

  Abstract                 = { This paper examines a mathematical model for the coevolution of parasite virulence and host resistance under a multilocus gene- for-gene interaction. The degrees of parasite virulence and host resistance show coevolutionary cycles for sufficiently small costs of virulence and resistance. Besides these coevolutionary cycles of a longer period, multilocus genotype frequencies show complex fluctuations over shorter periods. All multilocus genotypes are maintained within host and parasite classes having the same number of resistant/virulent alleles and their frequencies fluctuate with approximately equally displaced phases. If either the cost of virulence or the number of resistance loci is larger then a threshold, the host maintains the static polymorphism of singly (or doubly or more, depending on the cost of resistance) resistant genotypes and the parasite remains universally avirulent. In other words, host polymorphism can prevent the invasion of any virulent strain in the parasite. Thus, although assuming an empirically common type of asymmetrical gene-for-gene interaction, both host and parasite populations can maintain polymorphism in each locus and retain complex fluctuations. Implications for the red queen hypothesis of the evolution of sex and the control of multiple drug resistance are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {The structure of the genetic code implies strict Watson-Crick base pairing in the first two codon positions, while the third position is known to be degenerate, thus allowing wobble base pairing. Recent crystal structures of near-cognate tRNAs accommodated into the ribosomal A-site, however, show canonical geometry even with first and second position mismatches. This immediately raises the question of whether these structures correspond to tautomerization of the base pairs. Further, if unusual tautomers are indeed trapped why do they not cause errors in decoding? Here, we use molecular dynamics free energy calculations of ribosomal complexes with cognate and near-cognate tRNAs to analyze the structures and energetics of G-U mismatches in the first two codon positions. We find that the enol tautomer of G is almost isoenergetic with the corresponding ketone in the first position, while it is actually more stable in the second position. Tautomerization of U, on the other hand is highly penalized. The presence of the unusual enol form of G thus explains the crystallographic observations. However, the calculations also show that this tautomer does not cause high codon reading error frequencies, as the resulting tRNA binding free energies are significantly higher than for the cognate complex.},

The Coding Sequence and Structure (CSandS) database developed in this work provides a detailed mapping between over 4000 solved protein structures and their mRNA. CSandS facilitates a comprehensive analysis of codon usage over many organisms. In assigning translation speed, we find that relative codon usage is less informative than tRNA concentration. For all speed measures, no evidence was found that domain boundaries are enriched with slow codons. In fact, genes seemingly avoid slow codons around structurally defined domain boundaries. Translation speed, however, does decrease at the transition into secondary structure. Codons are identified that have structural preferences significantly different from the amino acid they encode. However, each organism has its own set of 'significant codons'. Our results support the premise that codons encode more information than merely amino acids and give insight into the role of translation in protein folding. },

In this paper two strategies were used to ameliorate these confounding factors. A unique South African sample including 190 individuals of the relatively, reproductively isolated Afrikaner population was assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests in an attempt to identify a BPD-associated quantitative trait or endophenotype. BPD individuals performed significantly worse than their unaffected relatives on visual and verbal memory tasks, a finding congruent with the literature. A focused linkage and family-based association study was carried out using this memory-related endophenotype. In the largest 77-strong Afrikaner pedigree significant evidence for linkage was detected on chromosome 22q11, a region previously implicated in BPD. The quantitative transmission disequilibrium tests-based association analysis suggested that functional variants of the DRD4 and MAO-A genes modulate memory-related cognition. We speculate that polymorphisms at these loci may predispose to a subtype of BPD characterized by memory-related deficits. }

  Abstract                 = {The sequencing of the chimpanzee genome and the comparison with its human counterpart have begun to reveal the spectrum of genetic changes that has accompanied human evolution. In addition to gross karyotypic rearrangements such as the fusion that formed human chromosome 2 and the human specific pericentric inversions of chromosomes 1 and 18, there is considerable submicroscopic structural variation involving deletions, duplications, and inversions. Lineage. specific segmental duplications, detected by array comparative genomic hybridization and direct sequence comparison, have made a very significant contribution to this structural divergence, which is at least three-fold greater than that due to nucleotide substitutions. Since structural genomic changes may have given rise to irreversible functional differences between the diverging species, their detailed analysis could help to identify the biological processes that have accompanied speciation. To this end, interspecies comparisons have revealed numerous human-specific gains and losses of genes as well as changes in gene expression. The very considerable structural diversity (polymorphism) evident within both lineages has, however, hampered the analysis of the structural divergence between the human and chimpanzee genomes. The concomitant evaluation of genetic divergence and diversity at the nucleotide level has nevertheless served to identify many genes that have evolved under positive selection and may thus have been involved in the development of human lineage specific traits. Genes that display signs of weak negative selection have also been identified and could represent candidate loci for complex genomic disorders. Here, we review recent progress in comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes and discuss how the differences detected have improved our understanding of the evolution of the human genome.},

The model is applied to the sample configurations of nucleotides in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba. Assuming a synonymous mutation rate of 1.5 X 10(-8) per site per year and 10 generations per year, we obtain estimates for the effective population size (N(e) = 6.5 X 10(6)), the species divergence time (t(div) = 3.74 million years), and an average selection coefficient (sigma = 1.53 X 10(-6) per generation for advantageous or mildly detrimental replacements), although it is conceivable that only two of the amino acid replacements were selected and the rest neutral. The analysis, which includes a sampling theory for the independent infinite sites model with selection, also suggests the estimate that the number of amino acids in the enzyme that are susceptible to favorable mutation is in the range 2-23 at any one time. The approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of a 2 X 2 contingency table to compare fixed differences and polymorphic sites with silent sites and amino acid replacements.},

A central core of about 4000 genes is shared by all the sequenced yeast genomes. Gains of genes by horizontal gene transfer seem to be very rare. Gene losses are more frequent, and losses of whole sets of genes in some pathways in some species can be understood in terms of species-specific differences in biology. The wholesale loss of redundant copies of duplicated genes after whole-genome duplication in the ancestor of one clade of yeasts is likely to have caused the emergence of many reproductively isolated lineages of yeasts at that time, but other processes are responsible for species barriers that arose more recently among close relatives of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

By sequencing the K. polysporus genome and comparing it with the S. cerevisiae genome using a likelihood model of gene loss, we show that these species diverged very soon after the WGD, when their common ancestor contained > 9,000 genes. The two genomes subsequently converged onto similar current sizes (5,600 protein-coding genes each) and independently retained sets of duplicated genes that are strikingly similar. Almost half of their surviving single-copy genes are not orthologs but paralogs formed by WGD, as would be expected if most gene pairs were resolved independently. In addition, by comparing the pattern of gene loss among K. polysporus, S. cerevisiae, and three other yeasts that diverged after the WGD, we show that the patterns of gene loss changed over time. Initially, both members of a duplicate pair were equally likely to be lost, but loss of the same gene copy in independent lineages was increasingly favored at later time points. This trend parallels an increasing restriction of reciprocal gene loss to more slowly evolving gene pairs over time and suggests that, as duplicate genes diverged, one gene copy became favored over the other. The apparent low initial sequence divergence of the gene pairs leads us to propose that the yeast WGD was probably an autopolyploidization. },

  Abstract                 = {A paradigm of evolutionary biology is that adaptation and reproductive isolation are caused by a nearly infinite number of mutations of individually small effect. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the genetic basis of pollinator discrimination in two closely related species of monkeyflowers that differ in their major pollinators. This system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the genetic architecture of adaptation and speciation because floral traits that confer pollinator specificity also contribute to premating reproductive isolation. We asked: (i) What floral traits cause pollinator discrimination among plant species? and (ii) What is the genetic basis of these traits? We examined these questions by using data obtained from a large-scale field experiment where genetic markers were employed to determine the genetic basis of pollinator visitation. Observations of F2 hybrids produced by crossing bee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii with hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus cardinalis revealed that bees preferred large flowers low in anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments, whereas hummingbirds favored nectar-rich flowers high in anthocyanins. An allele that increases petal carotenoid concentration reduced bee visitation by 80\%, whereas an allele that increases nectar production doubled hummingbird visitation. These results suggest that genes of large effect on pollinator preference have contributed to floral evolution and premating reproductive isolation in these monkeyflowers. This work contributes to growing evidence that adaptation and reproductive isolation may often involve major genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Decades of research demonstrate that conflict shapes and permeates a broad range of family processes. In the current article, we argue that greater insight, integration of knowledge, and empirical achievement in the study of family conflict can be realized by utilizing a powerful theory from evolutionary biology that is barely known within psychology: parent-offspring conflict theory (POCT). In the current article, we articulate POCT for psychological scientists, extend its scope by connecting it to the broader framework of life history theory, and draw out its implications for understanding conflict within human families. We specifically apply POCT to 2 instances of early mother-offspring interaction (prenatal conflict and weaning conflict); discuss the effects of genetic relatedness on behavioral conflict between parents, children, and their siblings; review the emerging literature on parent-offspring conflict over the choice of mates and spouses; and examine parent-offspring conflict from the perspective of imprinted genes. This review demonstrates the utility of POCT, not only for explaining what is known about conflict within families but also for generating novel hypotheses, suggesting new lines of research, and moving us toward the "big picture" by integrating across biological and psychological domains of knowledge. },

  Abstract                 = {The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a widely used model organism to study basic mechanisms of eukaryotic biology, but unlike other model organisms, its proteome remains largely uncharacterized. Using a shotgun proteomics approach based on multidimensional prefractionation and tandem mass spectrometry, we have detected similar to 30\% of the theoretical fission yeast proteome. Applying statistical modelling to normalize spectral counts to the number of predicted tryptic peptides, we have performed label-free quantification of 1465 proteins. The fission yeast protein data showed considerable correlations with {mRNA} levels and with the abundance of orthologous proteins in budding yeast. Functional pathway analysis indicated that the {mRNA} protein correlation is strong for proteins involved in signalling and metabolic processes, but increasingly discordant for components of protein complexes, which clustered in groups with similar {mRNA}-protein ratios. Self-organizing map clustering of large-scale protein and {mRNA} data from fission and budding yeast revealed coordinate but not always concordant expression of components of functional pathways and protein complexes. This finding reaffirms at the protein level the considerable divergence in gene expression patterns of the two model organisms that was noticed in previous transcriptomic studies. }

RNA evolution \emph{in vitro} represents a basis for the development of a new and comprehensive model of evolution, focusing on the phenotype and its fitness relevant properties. Relations between genotypes and phenotypes are described by mappings from genotype space onto a space of phenotypes, which are many-to-one and thus give ample room for neutrality as expressed by the existence of extended neutral networks in genotype space. The RNA model reduces genotype-phenotype relations to mappings from sequences into secondary structures of minimal free energies and allows for derivation of otherwise inaccessible quantitative results. Continuity and discontinuity in evolution are defined through a new notion of accessibility in phenotype space that provides a basis for straightforward interpretation of computer simulations on RNA optimization; furthermore, it reveals the constructive role of random genomic drift in the search for phenotypes of higher fitness. The effects of population size on the course of evolutionary optimization can be predicted quantitatively by means of a simple stochastic model based on a birth-and-death process with immigration. },

  Abstract                 = {RNA secondary structures are derived from RNA sequences, which are strings built form the natural four letter nucleotide alphabet, {AUGC}. These coarse-grained structures, in turn, are tantamount to constrained strings over a three letter alphabet. Hence, the secondary structures are discrete objects and the number of sequences always exceeds the number of structures. The sequences built from two letter alphabets form perfect structures when the nucleotides can form a base pair, as is the case with {GC} or {AU}, but the relation between the sequences and structures differs strongly from the four letter alphabet. A comprehensive theory of RNA structure is presented, which is based on the concepts of sequence space and shape space, being a space of structures. It sets the stage for modelling processes in ensembles of RNA molecules like evolutionary optimization or kinetic folding as dynamical phenomena guided by mappings between the two spaces. The number of minimum free energy (mfe) structures is always smaller than the number of sequences, even for two letter alphabets. Folding of RNA molecules into mfe energy structures constitutes a non-invertible mapping from sequence space onto shape space. The preimage of a structure in sequence space is defined as its neutral network. Similarly the set of suboptimal structures is the preimage of a sequence in shape space. This set represents the conformation space of a given sequence. The evolutionary optimization of structures in populations is a process taking place in sequence space, whereas kinetic folding occurs in molecular ensembles that optimize free energy in conformation space. Efficient folding algorithms based on dynamic programming are available for the prediction of secondary structures for given sequences. The inverse problem, the computation of sequences for predefined structures, is an important tool for the design of RNA molecules with tailored properties. Simultaneous folding or cofolding of two or more RNA molecules can be modelled readily at the secondary structure level and allows prediction of the most stable (mfe) conformations of complexes together with suboptimal states. Cofolding algorithms are important tools for efficient and highly specific primer design in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and help to explain the mechanisms of small interference RNA (si-RNA) molecules in gene regulation. The evolutionary optimization of RNA structures is illustrated by the search for a target structure and mimics aptamer selection in evolutionary biotechnology. It occurs typically in steps consisting of short adaptive phases interrupted by long epochs of little or no obvious progress in optimization. During these quasi-stationary epochs the populations are essentially confined to neutral networks where they search for sequences that allow a continuation of the adaptive process. Modelling RNA evolution as a simultaneous process in sequence and shape space provides answers to questions of the optimal population size and mutation rates. Kinetic folding is a stochastic process in conformation space. Exact solutions are derived by direct simulation in the form of trajectory sampling or by solving the master equation. The exact solutions can be approximated straightforwardly by Arrhenius kinetics on barrier trees, which represent simplified versions of conformational energy landscapes. The existence of at least one sequence forming any arbitrarily chosen pair of structures is granted by the intersection theorem. Folding kinetics is the key to understanding and designing multistable RNA molecules or RNA switches. These RNAs form two or more long lived conformations, and conformational changes occur either spontaneously or are induced through binding of small molecules or other biopolymers. RNA switches are found in nature where they act as elements in genetic and metabolic regulation. The reliability of RNA secondary structure prediction is limited by the accuracy with which the empirical parameters can be determined and by principal deficiencies, for example by the lack of energy contributions resulting from tertiary interactions. In addition, native structures may be determined by folding kinetics rather than by thermodynamics. We address the first problem by considering base pair probabilities or base pairing entropies, which are derived from the partition function of conformations. A high base pair probability corresponding to a low pairing entropy is taken as an indicator of a high reliability of prediction. Pseudoknots are discussed as an example of a tertiary interaction that is highly important for RNA function. Moreover, pseudoknot formation is readily incorporated into structure prediction algorithms. Some examples of experimental data on RNA secondary structures that are readily explained using the landscape concept are presented. They deal with (i) properties of RNA molecules with random sequences, (ii) RNA molecules from restricted alphabets, (iii) existence of neutral networks, (iv) shape space covering, (v) riboswitches and (vi) evolution of noncoding RNAs as an example of evolution restricted to neutral networks. },

The peptide repertoire represents virtually all cellular translation products, and can thus reveal a foreign presence inside the cell. These peptides are derived from not only conventional but also cryptic translational reading frames, including some without conventional AUG codons. To define the mechanism that generates these cryptic peptides, we used T cells as probes to analyze the peptides generated in transfected cells. We found that when CUG acts as an alternate initiation codon, it can be decoded as leucine rather than the expected methionine residue. The leucine start does not depend on an internal ribosome entry site-like mRNA structure, and its efficiency is enhanced by the Kozak nucleotide context. Furthermore, ribosomes scan 5' to 3' specifically for the CUG initiation codon in a eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-independent manner. Because eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 is frequently targeted to inhibit protein synthesis, this novel translation mechanism allows stressed cells to display antigenic peptides. This initiation mechanism could also be used at non-AUG initiation codons often found in viral transcripts as well as in a growing list of cellular genes.},

The prediction of metal ion-binding sites have success rates between 90\% and 97\% depending on the metal, with an overall standard deviation on the position of binding of 0.3-0.6 angstrom. The following metals were included in the force field: Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Cu2+. As a result, the current version of Fold-X can accurately decorate a protein structure with biologically important ions and water molecules. Additionally, the free energy of binding of Ca2+ and Zn2+ (i.e., the natural logarithm of the dissociation constant) and its dependence on ionic strength correlate reasonably well with the experimental data available in the literature, allowing one to discriminate between highand low-affinity binding sites. Importantly, the accuracy of the energy prediction presented here is sufficient to efficiently discriminate between Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ binding.},

Here, I present an analytical method for solving models of nearly neutral evolution at steady state. The steady state solution applies to any constant fitness landscape under a dynamic of successive fixations, each of which occurs on the background of the population's most recent common ancestor. Because this dynamic neglects the effects of polymorphism in the population beyond the mutant allele under consideration, the steady state solution provides a decent approximation of evolutionary dynamics when the population mutation rate is low (Nu << 1). To demonstrate the method, I apply it to two examples: Fisher's geometric model (FGM), and a simple model of molecular evolution. Since recent papers have studied the steady state behavior of FGM under this dynamic, I analyze its behavior in detail and compare the results with previous work. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The code exhibits two salient structural characteristics: it possesses a distinct organization that makes it extremely robust to errors in replication and translation, and it is highly redundant. The origin of these properties has intrigued researchers since the code was first discovered. One suggestion, which is the subject of this review, is that the code's organization is the outcome of the coevolution of genes and genetic codes. In 1968, Francis Crick explored the possible implications of coevolution at different stages of code evolution. Although he argues that coevolution was likely to influence the evolution of the code, he concludes that it falls short of explaining the organization of the code we see today. The recent application of mathematical modeling to study the effects of errors on the course of coevolution, suggests a different conclusion. It shows that coevolution readily generates genetic codes that are highly redundant and similar in their error-correcting organization to the standard code. We review this recent work and suggest that further affirmation of the role of coevolution can be attained by investigating the extent to which the outcome of coevolution is robust to other influences that were present during the evolution of the code.},

Here we show that a precise mathematical analogy can be drawn between certain evolutionary and thermodynamic systems, allowing application of the powerful machinery of statistical physics to analysis of a family of evolutionary models. Analytical results that follow directly from this approach include the steady-state distribution of fixed genotypes and the load in finite populations. The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal. Finally, just as the free energy function quantitatively characterizes the balance between energy and entropy, a free fitness function provides an analytical expression for the balance between natural selection and stochastic drift. },

  Abstract                 = {The rate of molecular evolution can vary among lineages. Sources of this variation have differential effects on synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates. Changes in effective population size or patterns of natural selection will mainly alter nonsynonymous substitution rates. Changes in generation length or mutation rates are likely to have an impact on both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates. By comparing changes in synonymous and nonsynonymous rates, the relative contributions of the driving forces of evolution can be better characterized. Here, we introduce a procedure for estimating the chronological rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions on the branches of an evolutionary tree. Because the widely used ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous rates is not designed to detect simultaneous increases or simultaneous decreases in synonymous and nonsynonymous rates, the estimation of these rates rather than their ratio can improve characterization of the evolutionary process. With our Bayesian approach, we analyze cytochrome oxidase subunit I evolution in primates and infer that nonsynonymous rates have a greater tendency to change over time than do synonymous rates. Our analysis of these data also suggests that rates have been positively correlated. },

While genome-wide measurement of {mRNA} levels was one of the first applications of these advances, other important aspects of gene expression are also amenable to a genomic approach, for example, the translation of message into protein. Earlier we reported a high throughput technology for simultaneously studying {mRNA} level and translation, which we termed translation state array analysis, or TSAA. The current studies test the proposition that TSAA can identify novel instances of translation regulation at the genome-wide level. As a biological model, cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were cell cycle-arrested using either alpha-factor or the temperature-sensitive cdc15-2 allele. Forty-eight {mRNA}s were found to change significantly in translation state following release from a-factor arrest, including genes involved in pheromone response and cell cycle arrest such as BAR1, SST2, and FAR1. After the shift of the cdc15-2 strain from 37 degreesC to 25 degreesC, 54 {mRNA}s were altered in translation state, including the products of the stress genes HSP82, HSC82, and SSA2. Thus, regulation at the translational level seems to play a significant role in the response of yeast cells to external physical or biological cues. In contrast, surprisingly few genes were found to be translationally controlled as cells progressed through the cell cycle. Additional refinements of TSAA should allow characterization of both transcriptional and translational regulatory networks on a genomic scale, providing an additional layer of information that can be integrated into models of system biology and function.},

We model two selective forces acting on histo-blood group antigens that may account for this polymorphism. The first is generated by the invasion of opportunistic bacterial or other pathogens that interact with the epithelial-mucosal surfaces. The bacteria adapt to the microenvironments of common host phenotypes and so create frequency-dependent selection for rarer host alleles. The second is generated by intracellular viruses, and accounts for the observed differentials between the ABO-phenotype frequencies. It is thought that viruses acquire histo-blood group structures as part of their envelope from their previous host. The presence of host antigens on the viral envelope causes differential transmission of the virus between host types owing to the asymmetric action of ABO natural antibodies. Our model simulations show that these two forces acting together can account for the major features of the ABO polymorphism in humans. }

To understand the common features and differences among viruses we analyzed the genomic characteristics of a representative collection of all sequenced vertebrate-infecting DNA viruses. This revealed that patterns of codon usage bias are strongly correlated with overall genomic GC content, suggesting that genome-wide mutational pressure, rather than natural selection for specific coding triplets, is the main determinant of codon usage. Further, we observed a striking difference in CpG content between DNA viruses with large and small genomes. While the majority of large genome viruses show the expected frequency of CpG, most small genome viruses had CpG contents far below expected values. The exceptions to this generalization, the large gammaherpesviruses and iridoviruses and the small dependoviruses, have sufficiently different life-cycle characteristics that they may help reveal some of the factors shaping the evolution of CpG usage in viruses. },

CPV emerged from feline panleukopenia parvovirus (FPLV) or a closely related virus, differing at several key amino acid residues. Here we characterize the evolutionary processes underlying the emergence of CPV. Although FPLV has remained an endemic infection in its host populations, we show that, since the 1970s, the newly emerged CPV has undergone an epidemic-like pattern of logistic/exponential growth, effectively doubling its population size every few years. This rapid population growth was associated with a lineage of CPV that acquired a broader host range and greater infectivity. Recombination played no role in the emergence of CPV. Rather, any preexisting variation in the donor species and the subsequent rapid adaptation of the virus to canines were likely dependent on a high rate of mutation and the positive selection of mutations in the major capsid gene. Strikingly, although these single-stranded viruses have a DNA genome and use cellular replication machinery, their rate of nucleotide substitution is closer to that of RNA viruses than to that of double-stranded DNA viruses.}

It has been shown that the melting of the ribosome-binding site (RBS) plays a prominent role in this thermosensing process. However, little is known as to how widespread this melting phenomenon is as earlier studies on the subject have worked with a small sample of known RNA thermometers. We have developed a novel method of studying the melting of RNAs with temperature by computationally sampling the distribution of the RNA structures at various temperatures using the RNA folding software Vienna. In this study, we compared the thermosensing property of 100 randomly selected mRNAs and three well known thermometers rpoH, ibpA and agsA sequences from E. coli. We also compared the rpoH sequences from 81 mesophilic proteobacteria. Although both rpoH and ibpA show a higher rate of melting at their RBS compared with the mean of non-thermometers, contrary to our expectations these higher rates are not significant. Surprisingly, we also do not find any significant differences between rpoH thermometers from other gamma-proteobacteria and E. coli non-thermometers. },

In general, studies of codon usage bias (CUB) assume that codons with higher tRNA abundance have lower missense error rates. Using a model of protein translation based on tRNA competition and intra-ribosomal kinetics, we show that this assumption can be violated when tRNA abundances are positively correlated across the genetic code. Examining the distribution of tRNA abundances across 73 bacterial genomes from 20 different genera, we find a consistent positive correlation between tRNA abundances across the genetic code. This work challenges one of the fundamental assumptions made in over 30 years of research on CUB that codons with higher tRNA abundances have lower missense error rates and that missense errors are the primary selective force responsible for CUB. },

  Abstract                 = {The genetic code is redundant with most amino acids using multiple codons. In many organisms, codon usage is biased toward particular codons. Understanding the adaptive and nonadaptive forces driving the evolution of codon usage bias (CUB) has been an area of intense focus and debate in the fields of molecular and evolutionary biology. However, their relative importance in shaping genomic patterns of CUB remains unsolved. Using a nested model of protein translation and population genetics, we show that observed gene level variation of CUB in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be explained almost entirely by selection for efficient ribosomal usage, genetic drift, and biased mutation. The correlation between observed codon counts within individual genes and our model predictions is 0.96. Although a variety of factors shape patterns of CUB at the level of individual sites within genes, our results suggest that selection for efficient ribosome usage is a central force in shaping codon usage at the genomic scale. In addition, our model allows direct estimation of codon-specific mutation rates and elongation times and can be readily applied to any organism with high-throughput expression datasets. More generally, we have developed a natural framework for integrating models of molecular processes to population genetics models to quantitatively estimate parameters underlying fundamental biological processes, such a protein translation.},

Every newly sequenced genome uncovers new genes, families, and folds. Where do these new genes come from? How do gene duplication and subsequent divergence of sequence and structure affect the fitness of the organism? What role does regulation play in the evolution of proteins and folds?

  Abstract                 = {Background: Cells react to changing intraand extracellular signals by dynamically modulating complex biochemical networks. Cellular responses to extracellular signals lead to changes in gene and protein expression. Since the majority of genes encode proteins, we investigated possible correlations between protein parameters and gene expression patterns to identify proteome-wide characteristics indicative of trends common to expressed proteins. Results: Numerous bioinformatics methods were used to filter and merge information regarding gene and protein annotations. A new statistical time point-oriented analysis was developed for the study of dynamic correlations in large time series data. The method was applied to investigate microarray datasets for different cell types, organisms and processes, including human B and T cell stimulation, Drosophila melanogaster life span, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. Conclusion: We show that the properties of proteins synthesized correlate dynamically with the gene expression profile, indicating that not only is the actual identity and function of expressed proteins important for cellular responses but that several physicochemical and other protein properties correlate with gene expression as well. Gene expression correlates strongly with amino acid composition, composition- and sequence-derived variables, functional, structural, localization and gene ontology parameters. Thus, our results suggest that a dynamic relationship exists between proteome properties and gene expression in many biological systems, and therefore this relationship is fundamental to understanding cellular mechanisms in health and disease. }

We define both these quantities and calculate these analytically. Fidelity is a measure of the quality of the products, while the total quantity of products synthesized in a given interval depends on the speed of polymerization. We show that for synthesizing a large quantity of proteins, it is not necessary to sacrifice the quality.

The ribosome is a molecular motor that utilizes the template mRNA strand also as the track. Thus, in each step the ribosome moves forward by one codon and, simultaneously, elongates the protein by one amino acid. We present a theoretical model that captures most of the main steps in the mechanochemical cycle of a ribosome. The stochastic movement of the ribosome consists of an alternating sequence of pause and translocation; the sum of the durations of a pause and the following translocation is the time of dwell of the ribosome at the corresponding codon. We derive the analytical expression for the distribution of the dwell times of a ribosome in our model. Wherever experimental data are available, our theoretical predictions are consistent with those results. We suggest appropriate experiments to test the new predictions of our model, particularly the effects of the quality control mechanism of the ribosome and that of their crowding on the mRNA track.},

  Abstract                 = {The process of polymerizing a protein by a ribosome, using a messenger RNA (mRNA) as the corresponding template, is called translation. Ribosome may be regarded as a molecular motor for which the mRNA template serves also as the track. Often several ribosomes may translate the same (mRNA) simultaneously. The ribosomes bound simultaneously to a single mRNA transcript are the members of a polyribosome (or, simply, polysome). Experimentally measured polysome profile gives the distribution of polysome sizes. Recently a breakthrough in determining the instantaneous positions of the ribosomes on a given mRNA track has been achieved and the technique is called ribosome profiling (Ingolia et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2010). Motivated by the success of these techniques, we have studied the spatio-temporal organization of ribosomes by extending a theoretical model that we have reported elsewhere (Sharma and Chowdhury, 2011). This extended version of our model incorporates not only (i) mechano-chemical cycle of individual ribomes, and (ii) their steric interactions, but also (iii) the effects of (a) kinetic proofreading, (b) translational infidelity, (c) ribosome recycling, and (d) sequence inhomogeneities. The theoretical framework developed here will serve in guiding further experiments and in analyzing the data to gain deep insight into various kinetic processes involved in translation.

However, in other species selection appears to have been ineffective. Here, we introduce a population genetics-based model for quantifying the extent to which selection has been effective. The approach is applied to 80 phylogenetically diverse bacterial species for which whole genome sequences are available. The strength of selected codon usage bias, S, is found to vary substantially among species; in 30\% of the genomes examined, there was no significant evidence that selection had been effective. Values of S are highly positively correlated with both the number of rRNA operons and the number of {tRNA} genes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that species exposed to selection for rapid growth have more rRNA operons, more {tRNA} genes and more strongly selected codon usage bias. For example, Clostridium perfringens, the species with the highest value of S, can have a generation time as short as 7 min. },

  Abstract                 = {The frequencies of alternative synonymous codons vary both among species and among genes from the same genome. These patterns have been inferred to reflect the action of natural selection. Here we evaluate this in bacteria. While intragenomic variation in many species is consistent with selection favouring translationally optimal codons, much of the variation among species appears to be due to biased patterns of mutation. The strength of selection on codon usage can be estimated by two different approaches. First, the extent of bias in favour of translationally optimal codons in highly expressed genes, compared to that in genes where selection is weak, reveals the long-term effectiveness of selection. Here we show that the strength of selected codon usage bias is highly correlated with bacterial growth rate, suggesting that selection has favoured translational efficiency. Second, the pattern of bias towards optimal codons at polymorphic sites reveals the ongoing action of selection. Using this approach we obtained results that were completely consistent with the first method; importantly, the frequency spectra of optimal codons at polymorphic sites were similar to those predicted under an equilibrium model. Highly expressed genes in Escherichia coli appear to be under continuing strong selection, whereas selection is very weak in genes expressed at low levels.},

  Abstract                 = {The term 'genomic disorder' refers to a disease that is caused by an alteration of the genome that results in complete loss, gain or disruption of the structural integrity of a dosage sensitive gene(s). In most of the common chromosome deletion/duplication syndromes, the rearranged genomic segments are flanked by large (usually >10 kb), highly homologous low copy repeat (LCR) structures that can act as recombination substrates. Recombination between non-allelic LCR copies, also known as non-allelic homologous recombination, can result in deletion or duplication of the intervening segment. Recent findings suggest that other chromosomal rearrangements, including reciprocal, Robertsonian and jumping translocations, inversions, isochromosomes and small marker chromosomes, may also involve susceptibility to rearrangement related to genome structure or architecture. In several cases, LCRs, AT-rich palindromes and pericentromeric repeats are located at such rearrangement breakpoints. Analysis of the products of recombination at the junctions of the rearrangements reveals both homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining as causative mechanisms. Thus, a more global concept of genomic disorders emerges in which susceptibility to rearrangements occurs due to underlying complex genomic architecture. Interestingly, this architecture plays a role not only in disease etiology, but also in primate genome evolution. In this review, we discuss recent advances regarding general mechanisms for the various rearrangements of our genome, and potential models for rearrangements with non-homologous breakpoint regions.},

As a common index for all levels, we suggest Shannon's (S)H, already used in information theory and biodiversity of ecological communities. Since Lewontin's first use of this index to describe human genetic variation, it has been used for variation of viruses, splice-junctions, and informativeness of pedigrees. However, until now there has been no theory to predict expected values of this index under given genetic and demographic conditions. We present a new null theory for (S)H at the genetic level, and show that this index has advantages including (i) independence of measures at each hierarchical level of organization; (ii) robust estimation of genetic exchange over a wide range of conditions; (iii) ability to incorporate information on population size; and (iv) explicit relationship to standard statistical tests. Utilization of this index in conjunction with other existing indices offers powerful insights into genetic processes. Our genetic theory is also extendible to the ecological community level, and thus can aid the comparison and integration of diversity at the genetic and community levels, including the need for measures of community diversity that incorporate the genetic differentiation between species.},

Nevertheless, certain genes with a high codon bias can be identified by correspondence analysis, and also by various indices of codon bias. These genes are very highly expressed, and a general trend (a decrease) in codon bias across genes seems to correspond to decreasing expression level. This, then, may be a general phenomenon in unicellular organisms. The unusually small effect of translational selection on the pattern of codon usage in lowly expressed genes in B. subtilis yields similar dinucleotide frequencies among different codon positions, and on complementary strands. These patterns could arise through selection on DNA structure, but more probably are largely determined by mutation. This prevalence of mutational bias could lead to difficulties in assessing whether open reading frames encode proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {A quantitative and highly parallel method for analysing deletion mutants has been developed to aid in determining the biological function of thousands of newly identified open reading frames (ORFs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This approach uses a PCR targeting strategy to generate large numbers of deletion strains. Each deletion strain is labelled with a unique 20-base tag sequence that can be detected by hybridization to a high-density oligonucleotide array. The tags serve as unique identifiers (molecular bar codes) that allow analysis of large numbers of deletion strains simultaneously through selective growth conditions. Hybridization experiments show that the arrays are specific, sensitive and quantitative. A pilot study with 11 known yeast genes suggests that the method can be extended to include all of the ORFs in the yeast genome, allowing whole genome analysis with a single selective growth condition and a single hybridization.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 is one of the fastest evolving entities known. Given that census population sizes of HIV-1 within individuals are much greater than the inverse mutation rate, every possible single point mutation in the viral genome occurs each generation. This enormous capability to generate genetic variation allows for escape from immune surveillance and antiviral therapy. However, compared to this potential, populations of HIV-1 within individuals exhibit little genetic variation. This discrepancy between the known mutation rate of HIV-1 and the average level of genetic variation in the env gene observed in vivo is reflected in comparisons of the actual numbers of productively infected cells, estimated as 10(7), and the effective population size, estimated as 10(3). Using approximate Bayesian computation, we evaluated several hypotheses based on a variety of selective and demographic processes to explain the low effective population size of HIV-1. Of the models we examined, the metapopulation model, in which HIV-1 evolves within an individual as a large collection of small subpopulations subject to frequent migration, extinction, and recolonization, was most consistent with the observed levels of genetic variation and the average frequencies of those variants. The metapopulation model links previous studies of viral dynamics and population genetics.},

In contradiction with previous studies, Lercher et al. (Hum. Mol. Genet., 12, 2411, 2003) recently reported a strong correlation between gene expression breadth and GC-content, suggesting that there might be a selective pressure favoring the concentration of housekeeping genes in GC-rich isochores. We reassessed this issue by examining in human and mouse the correlation between gene expression and GC-content, using different measures of gene expression (EST, SAGE and microarray) and different measures of GC-content. We show that correlations between GC-content and expression are very weak, and may vary according to the method used to measure expression. Such weak correlations have a very low predictive value. The strong correlations reported by Lercher et al. (2003) are because of the fact that they measured variables over neighboring genes windows. We show here that using gene windows artificially enhances the correlation. The assertion that the expression of a given gene depends on the GC-content of the region where it is located is therefore not supported by the data.},

Using experimental evolution with bacteriophage, we show here that the converse is also true. In populations small enough such that drift overwhelms selection and causes fitness to decrease, fitness declines down to a plateau. We demonstrate theoretically that both of these phenomena must be due either to changes in the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations, the size of mutational effects, or both. We use mutation accumulation experiments and molecular data from experimental evolution to show that the most significant change in mutational effects is a drastic increase in the rate of beneficial mutation as fitness decreases. In contrast, the size of mutational effects changes little even as organismal fitness changes over several orders of magnitude. These findings have significant implications for the dynamics of adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {That natural selection affects molecular evolution at synonymous sites in protein-coding sequences is well established and is thought to predominantly reflect selection for translational efficiency/accuracy mediated through codon bias. However, a recently developed maximum likelihood framework, when applied to 18 coding sequences in 3 species of Drosophila, confirmed an earlier report that the Notch gene in Drosophila melanogaster was evolving under selection in favor of those codons defined as unpreferred in this species. This finding opened the possibility that synonymous sites may be subject to a variety of selective pressures beyond weak selection for increased frequencies of the codons currently defined as "preferred'' in D. melanogaster. To further explore patterns of synonymous site evolution in Drosophila in a lineage-specific manner, we expanded the application of the maximum likelihood framework to 8,452 protein coding sequences with well-defined orthology in D. melanogaster, Drosophila sechellia, and Drosophila yakuba. Our analyses reveal intragenomic and interspecific variation in mutational patterns as well as in patterns and intensity of selection on synonymous sites. In D. melanogaster, our results provide little statistical evidence for recent selection on synonymous sites, and Notch remains an outlier. In contrast, in D. sechellia our findings provide evidence in support of selection predominantly in favor of preferred codons. However, there is a small subset of genes in this species that appear to be evolving under selection in favor of unpreferred codons, which indicates that selection on synonymous sites is not limited to the preferential fixation of mutations that enhance the speed or accuracy of translation in this species.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequence dependence of solvent accessibility in globular and membrane proteins is well established. However, this important structural property has been poorly investigated in nucleic acids. On the other hand investigation of structural determinants of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in gene expression are also in a primitive stage and there is a need to explore novel sequence and structural features of both DNA and RNA, which may explain both basic and regulatory mechanisms at various stages of expression. We have recently shown that the nucleotide accessibility in double-stranded DNA molecules strongly depends on sequence context and can be predicted using neighbor information. In this work, we investigate statistics, neighbor-dependence and predictability of nucleotide solvent accessibility for various types of RNA molecules (single-stranded, double-stranded, protein-unbound and protein-bound). It was found that average solvent accessibility of different RNA trinucleotides varies considerably. Interestingly, important translational signals (initiatory AUG codon, Shine-Dalgharno site) were characterized by high solvent accessibility that could be important for its selection in evolution. We also analyzed a relationship between nucleotide accessibility and synonymous codon usage bias in some genomes and find that the two properties are directly related. We believe that the analysis and prediction of nucleotide solvent accessibility opens new avenues to explore more biologically meaningful relationship between RNA structure and function.

  Abstract                 = {Using a mark-recapture technique in a small temperate stream, we described the movement of four fish species over a five-month period and developed a mathematical model that described the observed movement patterns. The movement distributions were generally leptokurtic, and two of the four species demonstrated some degree of upstream bias. There was little difference in movement among species or through time. There were no temporal correlations in probability of movement, movement direction, or distance moved. The spatial spread of the most abundant species, bluehead chubs, over a four-month period was characterized by upstream bias, diffusion-like spread, and persistent leptokurtosis. Bluehead chubs demonstrated complex relationships between probability of movement and size and growth, while creek chubs showed only an effect of size on probability of movement. Further, growth of individual bluehead chubs was correlated through time. These empirical results suggest the hypothesis that heterogeneity in phenotypic attributes, such as size and growth, is related to heterogeneity in movement behavior. A diffusion-advection model of bluehead chub movement, structured with two subgroups that dispersed at different rates ("fast fish" and "slow fish"), was parameterized and validated with the field data. This model with heterogeneity in movement rates generated the leptokurtic pattern observed in the field data, in contrast to the classic diffusion model without population heterogeneity, which produces a normal distribution. The results from this work suggest that heterogeneity in fitness-influencing attributes such as size and growth could explain heterogeneity in individual-level movement behavior and might underlie the leptokurtic patterns that have been observed at the population level in numerous field studies. },

  Abstract                 = {Meiotic recombination predominantly occurs at discrete genomic loci called recombination hotspots, but the features defining these areas are still largely unknown (reviewed in refs 1-5). To allow a comprehensive analysis of hotspot-associated DNA and chromatin characteristics, we developed a direct molecular approach for mapping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks that initiate recombination. Here we present the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in the mouse genome. Hotspot centres are mapped with approximately 200-nucleotide precision, which allows analysis of the fine structural details of the preferred recombination sites. We determine that hotspots share a centrally distributed consensus motif, possess a nucleotide skew that changes polarity at the centres of hotspots and have an intrinsic preference to be occupied by a nucleosome. Furthermore, we find that the vast majority of recombination initiation sites in mouse males are associated with testis-specific trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 that is distinct from histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation marks associated with transcription. The recombination map presented here has been derived from a homogeneous mouse population with a defined genetic background and therefore lends itself to extensive future experimental exploration. We note that the mapping technique developed here does not depend on the availability of genetic markers and hence can be easily adapted to other species with complex genomes. Our findings uncover several fundamental features of mammalian recombination hotspots and underline the power of the new recombination map for future studies of genetic recombination, genome stability and evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of genetic variants on phenotypic traits often depend on environmental and physiological conditions, but such gene-environment interactions are poorly understood. Recently developed approaches that treat transcript abundances of thousands of genes as quantitative traits offer the opportunity to broadly characterize the architecture of gene-environment interactions. We examined the genetic and molecular basis of variation in gene expression between two yeast strains (BY and RM) grown in two different conditions (glucose and ethanol as carbon sources). We observed that most transcripts vary by strain and condition, with 2,996, 3,448, and 2,037 transcripts showing significant strain, condition, and strain-condition interaction effects, respectively. We expression profiled over 100 segregants derived from a cross between BY and RM in both growth conditions, and identified 1,555 linkages for 1,382 transcripts that show significant gene-environment interaction. At the locus level, local linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms in cis-regulatory elements, tend to be more stable across conditions, such that they are more likely to show the same effect or the same direction of effect across conditions. Distant linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms influencing trans-acting factors, are more condition-dependent, and often show effects in different directions in the two conditions. We characterized a locus that influences expression of many growth-related transcripts, and showed that the majority of the variation is explained by polymorphism in the gene IRA2. The RM allele of IRA2 appears to inhibit Ras/PKA signaling more strongly than the BY allele, and has undergone a change in selective pressure. Our results provide a broad overview of the genetic architecture of gene-environment interactions, as well as a detailed molecular example, and lead to key insights into how the effects of different classes of regulatory variants are modulated by the environment. These observations will guide the design of studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.},

We find that the relative selection pressures exerted by chemoprophylactic (preventive) control strategies, chemotherapeutic (salvage) control strategies, and regimens involving "under-dosing" are critically dependent on a variety of host and parasite parameters (particularly host immunity and grazing behaviour, parasite fecundity, and the survival of the free-living stages on the pasture). Chemoprophylactic strategies are not necessarily more likely to exert a stronger selection pressure than chemotherapeutic strategies. Similarly, as one reduces dosage levels, there is a range of dose levels where under-dosing promotes resistance and a range of dose levels where under-dosing impedes resistance. The most dangerous dose is either that necessary to kill all the susceptible homozygotes, or that necessary to kill all the susceptible homozygotes and all the heterozygotes. Which one prevails depends upon model parameters. The stochastic formulation indicates that spatial heterogeneity in transmission may be a significant force in promoting the spread of resistant genotypes-at least when infection is at low levels.

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB), one of the oldest known human diseases. is still is one of the major causes of mortality, since two million people die each year from this malady. TB has many manifestations, affecting bone, the central nervous system, and many other organ systems, but it is primarily a pulmonary disease that is initiated by the deposition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, contained in aerosol droplets, onto lung alveolar surfaces. From this point, the progression of the disease can have several outcomes, determined largely by the response of the host immune system. The efficacy of this response is affected by intrinsic factors such as the genetics of the immune system as well as extrinsic factors, e.g., insults to the immune system and the nutritional and physiological state of the host. In addition, the pathogen may play a role in disease progression since some M. tuberculosis strains are reportedly more virulent than others, as defined by increased transmissibility as well as being associated with higher morbidity and mortality in infected individuals. Despite the widespread use of an attenuated live vaccine and several antibiotics, there is more TB than ever before, requiting new vaccines and drugs and more specific and rapid diagnostics. Researchers are utilizing information obtained from the complete sequence of the M. tuberculosis genome and from new genetic and physiological methods to identify targets in M. tuberculosis that will aid in the development of these sorely needed antitubercular agents. },

  Abstract                 = {Natural selection favors certain synonymous codons which aid translation in \emph{Escherichia coli}, yet codons not favored by translational selection persist. We use the frequency distributions of synonymous polymorphisms to test three hypotheses for the existence of translationally sub-optimal codons: (1) selection is a relatively weak force, so there is a balance between mutation, selection, and drift; (2) at some sites there is no selection on codon usage, so some synonymous sites are unaffected by translational selection; and (3) translationally sub-optimal codons are favored by alternative selection pressures at certain synonymous sites. We find that when all the data is considered, model I is supported and both models 2 and 3 are rejected as sole explanations for the existence of translationally sub-optimal codons. However, we find evidence in favor of both models 2 and 3 when the data is partitioned between groups of amino acids and between regions of the genes. Thus, all three mechanisms appear to contribute to the existence of translationally sub-optimal codons in E. coli. },

To account for the latter observation, we assume that the translation process is optimized in two respects: (i), the codon demand is optimized with respect to the supply of cognate {tRNA}s (composition of the {tRNA} pool); and (ii), for synonymous codons sharing the same cognate {tRNA}, the usage frequency of each codon correlates optimally with the stability of the codon-anticodon complex. These assumptions allow us to compute the relative rate constants of synonymous codons. Highly expressed genes, which produce 80-90\% of the protein mass in the E. coli cell, appear to have selected codons which make an optimal use of the {tRNA} pool.

  Abstract                 = {Heterologous expression and high yield purification of proteins are frequently required for structural and functional investigations. Purification of recombinant thermostable proteins is essentially trivial since unwanted mesophilic host protein can efficiently be removed by heat denaturation. However, heterologous expression in E. coli often results in truncated protein forms. In many cases, this is a consequence of abundant codons in heterologous genes, which are decoded by rare tRNAs in E. coli-a combination that can be responsible for translational stalling and termination during protein biosynthesis. Other complications may originate from potential initiation codons and ribosomal binding sites present inside the open reading frame of the target gene or from other less well defined phenomena such as mRNA instability. Separation of full-length protein from truncated forms is a serious chromatographic problem that can be solved in the expression step. We have investigated the heterologous expression and purification of two translation initiation factors from the hyperthermophilic sulphate-reducing archaeon, Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Expression in E. coli was optimised to avoid truncated forms completely by complementation with the plasmids pSJS1244, pRIG, pCODON+ and pLysSR.A.R.E harbouring and expressing genes encoding rare tRNAs corresponding to the codons AGA, AGG, AUA, CUA, GGA, AAG and CCC. Two expression strains, C41(DE3) and C43(DE3) were found highly advantageous when combined with rare tRNA encoding plasmids as compared to BL21(DE3). We have also investigated the effects of site directed mutagenesis on rare lysine encoding AAG doublets as well as two methionine residues preceded by potential ribosomal binding sites. The expression approach presented here has enabled us to purify gram quantities of full-length protein by one step of ion-exchange chromatography and is generally applicable to many other heterologously expressed thermostable proteins.

  Abstract                 = {Numerous computational methods exist to assess the mode and strength of natural selection in protein-coding sequences, yet how distinct methods relate to one another remains largely unknown. Here, we elucidate the relationship between two widely used phylogenetic modeling frameworks: dN/dS models and mutation-selection (MutSel) models. We derive a mathematical relationship between dN/dS and scaled selection coefficients, the focal parameters of MutSel models, and use this relationship to gain deeper insight into the behaviors, limitations, and applicabilities of these two modeling frameworks. We prove that, if all synonymous changes are neutral, standard MutSel models correspond to dN/dS <= 1. However, if synonymous codons differ in fitness, dN/dS can take on arbitrarily high values even if all selection is purifying. Thus, the MutSel modeling framework cannot necessarily accommodate positive, diversifying selection, while dN/dS cannot distinguish between purifying selection on synonymous codons and positive selection on amino acids. We further propose a new benchmarking strategy of dN/dS inferences against MutSel simulations and demonstrate that the widely used Goldman-Yang-style dN/dS models yield substantially biased dN/dS estimates on realistic sequence data. In contrast, the less frequently used Muse-Gaut-style models display much less bias. Strikingly, the least-biased and most precise dN/dS estimates are never found in the models with the best fit to the data, measured through both AIC and BIC scores. Thus, selecting models based on goodness-of-fit criteria can yield poor parameter estimates if the models considered do not precisely correspond to the underlying mechanism that generated the data. In conclusion, establishing mathematical links among modeling frameworks represents a novel, powerful strategy to pinpoint previously unrecognized model limitations and strengths.},

  Abstract                 = {The mutation causing Huntington's disease is an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat number beyond 35 in the 5' translated region of the gene. The mutation penetrance varies widely and depends on the CAG expansion length, the low pathological triplet range (36-41) showing a very low penetrance, possibly associated with late ages at onset. No research has so far yielded biomarkers for accurately predicting either age at onset or disease progression in at risk individuals. Specific markers able to follow-up mutation carrier subjects from the pre-symptomatic stages of life are crucial for testing experimental neuroprotective preventive therapies. Nevertheless, the factor accounting for the largest percentage of age at onset variation is the expanded repeat number within the gene. Over the years, this factor has helped in setting up models for genetically predicting age at onset. Once available for practical application in clinics, such models allowed phenotype-genotype correlations that were hitherto inconceivable. In this review, we discuss how these genetic models have been applied in clinical practice and comment on their potential value in searching for cerebral biomarkers of disease onset and severity and in designing trials of therapeutic drugs. },

  Abstract                 = {During primary HIV infection the viral load in plasma increases, reaches a peak, and then declines. Phillips has suggested that the decline is due to a limitation in the number of cells susceptible to HIV infection, while other authors have suggested that the decline in viremia is due to an immune response. Here we address this issue by developing models of primary HIV-1 infection, and by comparing predictions from these models with data from ten anti-retroviral, drug-naive, infected patients. Applying nonlinear least-squares estimation, we find that relatively small variations in parameters are capable of mimicking the highly diverse patterns found in patient viral load data. This approach yields an estimate of 2.5 days for the average lifespan of productively infected cells during primary infection, a Value that is consistent with results obtained by drug perturbation experiments. We find that the data from all ten patients are consistent with a target-cell-limited model from the time of initial infection until shortly after the peak in viremia. However, the kinetics of the subsequent fall and recovery in virus concentration in some patients are not consistent with the predictions of the target-cell-limited model. We illustrate that two possible immune response mechanisms, cytotoxic T lymphocyte destruction of infected target cells and cytokine suppression of viral replication, could account for declines in viral load data not predicted by the original target-cell-limited model. We conclude that some additional process, perhaps mediated by CD8 + T cells, is important in at least some patients. (C) 2000 Academic Press. },

We have examined the effect of this metabolic change, termed the diauxic shift, on the frequency of translational errors. Recoding sites are mRNA sequences that increase the frequency of translational errors, providing a convenient reporter of translational accuracy. We found that the diauxic shift causes no overall change in translational accuracy but does cause a strong reduction in the frequency of one type of programmed error: Ty + 1 frameshifting. Genetic data suggest that this effect may be due to changes in the relative amounts of tRNA participating in translation elongation.

  Abstract                 = {The ribosome is a molecular machine that converts genetic information in the form of RNA, into protein. Recent structural studies reveal a complex set of interactions between the ribosome and its ligands, mRNA and tRNA, that indicate ways in which the ribosome could avoid costly translational errors. Ribosomes must decode each successive codon accurately, and structural data provide a clear indication of how ribosomes limit recruitment of the wrong tRNA (sense errors). In a triplet-based genetic code there are three potential forward reading frames, only one of which encodes the correct protein. Errors in which the ribosome reads a codon out of the normal reading frame (frameshift errors) occur less frequently than sense errors, although it is not clear from structural data how these errors are avoided. Some mRNA sequences, termed programmed-frameshift sites, cause the ribosome to change reading frame. Based on recent work on these sites, this article proposes that the ribosome uses the structure of the codon-anticodon complex formed by the peptidyl-tRNA, especially its wobble interaction, to constrain the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA to the correct reading frame.},

Reverse transcription of {mRNA} followed by homologous recombination with the genome has been posited as a mechanism of intron loss, though little direct evidence of recent loss events has been described to support this model. We find supporting evidence for an {mRNA}-mediated mechanism of loss through comparative genome analyses that revealed a recent loss of 10 adjacent introns in a 22-exon gene in the human-pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. We surveyed the gene structures of the entire genomes of Cryptococcus gattii, which diverged from the C. neoformans lineage 37 million years ago (Mya), and C. neoformans var. grubii and var. neoformans, which diverged 18 Mya. Our comparison revealed greater than 99.9\% intron conservation, with evidence from 20 genes showing evidence of intron loss, but no convincing evidence of intron gain. Our findings confirm that Cryptococcus introns have been quite stable over recent evolutionary time, with occasional {mRNA}-mediated intron loss events. },

  Abstract                 = {Animals are often attracted to one another when selecting habitats, but little is known about the rules governing conspecific attraction. We use Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate alternative models of the effects of conspecifics on individual choice in the context of habitat selection. One set of models was tested using data collected on virgin female flies, Drosophila melanogaster, selecting habitats in the laboratory; a second set of models was tested using data collected on crabs, Ocypode rotundata, selecting foraging patches in the field. Patterns of space use in the flies were most consistent with models indicating that individuals were attracted to other females that selected traps during the same hour, as well as to cues left by females that had entered traps during the previous hour. Results for the crabs were most consistent with a model which assumes that individuals preferred to join the patch with the most crabs but that their ability to assess the number of crabs in alternative patches was constrained by basic psychophysical principles (Weber's law). These results provide support for hypotheses about the functional significance of conspecific attraction in the flies and the crabs and illustrate the richness of information about conspecific attraction that can be obtained when the same data set is confronted with alternative models of the ways that animals respond to one another when selecting habitats.}

  Abstract                 = {We describe the development of a novel plasmid-based assay for measuring the in vivo frequency of misincorporation of amino acids into polypeptide chains in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The assay is based upon the measurement of the catalytic activity of an active site mutant of type III chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT(III)) expressed in S. cerevisiae. A His195(CAC) --> Tyr195(UAC) mutant of CAT(III) is completely inactive, but catalytic activity can be restored by misincorporation of histidine at the mutant UAC codon. The average error frequency of misincorporation of histidine at this tyrosine UAC codon in wild-type yeast strains was measured as 0.5 x 10(-5) and this frequency was increased some 50-fold by growth in the presence of paromomycin, a known translational-error-inducing antibiotic. A detectable frequency of misincorporation of histidine at a mutant Ala195 GCU codon was also measured as 2 x 10(-5), but in contrast to the Tyr195 --> His195 misincorporation event, the frequency of histidine misincorporation at Ala195 GCU was not increased by paromomycin, inferring that this error did not result from miscognate codon-anticodon interaction. The His195 to Tyr195 missense error assay was used to demonstrate increased frequencies of missense error at codon 195 in SUP44 and SUP46 mutants. These two mutants have previously been shown to exhibit a translation termination error phenotype and the sup44(+) and sup46(+) genes encode the yeast ribosomal proteins S4 and S9, respectively. These data represent the first accurate in vivo measurement of a specific mistranslation event in a eukaryotic cell and directly confirm that the eukaryotic ribosome plays an important role in controlling missense errors arising from non-cognate codon-anticodon interactions.

  Abstract                 = {Life history theory tries to explain how evolution designs organisms to achieve reproductive success. The design is a solution to an ecological problem posed by the environment and subject to constraints intrinsic to the organism. Work on life histories has expanded the role of phenotypes in evolutionary theory, extending the range of predictions from genetic patterns to whole-organism traits directly connected to fitness. Among the questions answered are the following: Why are organisms small or large? Why do they mature early or late? Why do they have few or many offspring? Why do they have a short or a long life? Why must they grow old and die? the classical approach to life histories was optimization; it has had some convincing empirical success. Recently non-equilibrium approaches involving frequency-dependence, density-dependence, evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics, and explicit population dynamics have supplanted optimization as the preferred approach. They have not yet had as much empirical success, but there are logical reasons to prefer them, and they may soon extend the impact of life history theory into population dynamics and interspecific interactions in coevolving communities.}

  Abstract                 = {This paper illustrates the utility of applying evolutionary thought to medical issues with three examples: selection arenas, aging, and tradeoffs. First, the human female reproductive tract functions as a selection arena at two levels: in the ovaries, where atresia reduces 14 the number of oocytes by more than 99.99\% before any are ovulated, and in the uterus, where early embryos homozygous for immune genes are spontaneously aborted. These selective filters early in life have implications both for eugenics and for the anti-abortion movement. Second, the evolutionary theory of aging predicts that intrinsic mortality should reflect extrinsic mortality: if life for adults is risky, then it does not pay to invest in maintenance at the expense of reproduction. This idea is well confirmed, at least in populations where density effects are not important. While only organisms that reproduce asymmetrically should age, even bacteria reproduce asymmetrically, and they do age, suggesting that all organisms reproduce asymmetrically and therefore age. Third, tradeoffs are central to theories of phenotypic design, but the mechanisms that cause them remain obscure. A method is suggested to get at the mechanisms of tradeoffs by examining conflicts among functions over gene expression. It could be applied in humans to the tradeoff between reproductive performance and disease resistance. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

Many mitochondrial diseases remain unexplained, however, in part because only 40-60\% of the presumed 700-1,000 proteins involved in mitochondrial function and biogenesis have been identified(3). Here we apply a systematic functional screen using the pre-existing whole-genome pool of yeast deletion mutants(4-6) to identify mitochondrial proteins. Three million measurements of strain fitness identified 466 genes whose deletions impaired mitochondrial respiration, of which 265 were new. Our approach gave higher selection than other systematic approaches, including fivefold greater selection than gene expression analysis. To apply these advantages to human disorders involving mitochondria, human orthologs were identified and linked to heritable diseases using genomic map positions. },

  Abstract                 = {Is genetic evolution predictable ? Evolutionary developmental biologists have argued that, at least for morphological traits, the answer is a resounding yes. Most mutations causing morphological variation are expected to reside in the cis-regulatory, rather than the coding, regions of developmental genes. This "cis-regulatory hypothesis" has recently come under attack. In this review, we first describe and critique the arguments that have been proposed in support of the cis-regulatory hypothesis. We then test the empirical support for the cis-regulatory hypothesis with a comprehensive survey of mutations responsible for phenotypic evolution in multicellular organisms. Cis-regulatory mutations currently represent approximately 22\% of 331 identified genetic changes although the number of cis-regulatory changes published annually is rapidly increasing. Above the species level, cis-regulatory mutations altering morphology are more common than coding changes. Also, above the species level cis-regulatory mutations predominate for genes not involved in terminal differentiation. These patterns imply that the simple question "Do coding or cis-regulatory mutations cause more phenotypic evolution ?" hides more interesting phenomena. Evolution in different kinds of populations and over different durations may result in selection of different kinds of mutations. Predicting the genetic basis of evolution requires a comprehensive synthesis of molecular developmental biology and population genetics. }

This article describes the development of probabilistic models of undergraduate student problem solving in molecular genetics that detailed the spectrum of strategies students used when problem solving, and how the strategic approaches evolved with experience. The actions of 776 university sophomore biology majors from three molecular biology lecture courses were recorded and analyzed. Each of six simulations were first grouped by artificial neural network clustering to provide individual performance measures, and then sequences of these performances were probabilistically modeled by hidden Markov modeling to provide measures of progress. The models showed that students with different initial problem-solving abilities choose different strategies. Initial and final strategies varied across different sections of the same course and were not strongly correlated with other achievement measures. In contrast to previous studies, we observed no significant gender differences. We suggest that instructor interventions based on early student performances with these simulations may assist students to recognize effective and efficient problem-solving strategies and enhance learning.},

In the analysis of the properties of this model, particular consideration is given to the conditions under which temperate bacteriophage can become established and will be maintained in bacterial populations. The effects of the presence of resistant bacteria and virulent phage on these "existence" conditions for temperate viruses are considered. It is demonstrated that under broad conditions temperate phage will be maintained in bacterial populations and will coexist with virulent phage. Extrapolating from this formal consideration of the population biology of temperate bacteriophage, a number of hypotheses for the conditions under which temperate, rather than virulent, modes of phage reproduction are to be anticipated and the nature of the selective pressures leading to the evolution and persistence of this "benign" type of bacterial virus are reviewed and critically evaluated. Two hypotheses for the "advantages of temperance" are championed: (1) As a consequence of the allelopathic effects of diffusing phage, in physically structured habitats, lysogenic colonies are able to sequester resources and, in that way, have an advantage when competing with sensitive nonlysogens. (2) Lysogeny is an adaptation for phage to maintain their populations in "hard times," when the host bacterial density oscillates below that necessary for phage to be maintained by lytic infection alone.},

These results reject the hypotheses that regulation exists to prevent the waste of amino acids in useless protein or the detrimental activity of unnecessary proteins. While the cost of the process of protein expression occurs in all of the environments that we tested, the expression of the lactose permease could be costly or beneficial, depending on the environment.

The strong and specific induction of flagellar-coding genes during flagellar regeneration in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii suggests that transcriptional profiling of such cells would reveal new flagella-related genes. We have conducted a genome-wide analysis of RNA transcript levels during flagellar regeneration in Chlamydomonas by using maskless photolithography method-produced DNA oligonucleotide microarrays with unique probe sequences for all exons of the 19,803 predicted genes. This analysis represents previously uncharacterized whole-genome transcriptional activity profiling study in this important model organism. Analysis of strongly induced genes reveals a large set of known flagellar components and also identifies a number of important disease-related proteins as being involved with cilia and flagella, including the zebrafish polycystic kidney genes Qilin, Reptin, and Pontin, as well as the testis-expressed tubby-like protein TULP2.},

  Abstract                 = {In many organisms, selection acts on synonymous codons to improve translation. However, the precise basis of this selection remains unclear in the majority of species. Selection could be acting to maximize the speed of elongation, to minimize the costs of proofreading, or to maximize the accuracy of translation. Using several data sets, we find evidence that codon use in \emph{Escherichia coli} is biased to reduce the costs of both missense and nonsense translational errors. Highly conserved sites and genes have higher codon bias than less conserved ones, and codon bias is positively correlated to gene length and production costs, both indicating selection against missense errors. Additionally, codon bias increases along the length of genes, indicating selection against nonsense errors. Doublet mutations or replacement substitutions do not explain our observations. The correlations remain when we control for expression level and for conflicting selection pressures at the start and end of genes. Considering each amino acid by itself confirms our results. We conclude that selection on synonymous codon use in E. coli is largely due to selection for translational accuracy, to reduce the costs of both missense and nonsense errors. },

  Abstract                 = {The classic view of evolution as "shifting gene frequencies" in the Modern Synthesis literally means that evolution is the modulation of existing variation ("standing variation"), as opposed to a "new mutations" view of evolution as a 2-step process of mutational origin followed by acceptance-or-rejection (via selection and drift). The latter view has received renewed attention, yet its implications for evolutionary causation still are not widely understood. We review theoretical results showing that this conception of evolution allows for a role of mutation as a cause of nonrandomness, a role that could be important but has been misconceived and associated misleadingly with neutral evolution. Specifically, biases in the introduction of variation, including mutational biases, may impose predictable biases on evolution, with no necessary dependence on neutrality. As an example of how important such effects may be, we present a new analysis partitioning the variance in mean rates of amino acid replacement during human-chimpanzee divergence to components of codon mutation and amino acid exchangeability. The results indicate that mutational effects are not merely important but account for most of the variance explained. The challenge that such results pose for comparative genomics is to address mutational effects as a necessary part of any analysis of causal factors. To meet this challenge requires developing knowledge of mutation as a biological process, understanding how mutation imposes propensities on evolution, and applying methods of analysis that incorporate mutational effects.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic basis of gene expression variation has long been studied with the aim to understand the landscape of regulatory variants, but also more recently to assist in the interpretation and elucidation of disease signals. To date, many studies have looked in specific tissues and population-based samples, but there has been limited assessment of the degree of inter-population variability in regulatory variation. We analyzed genome-wide gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a total of 726 individuals from 8 global populations from the HapMap3 project and correlated gene expression levels with HapMap3 SNPs located in cis to the genes. We describe the influence of ancestry on gene expression levels within and between these diverse human populations and uncover a non-negligible impact on global patterns of gene expression. We further dissect the specific functional pathways differentiated between populations. We also identify 5,691 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) after controlling for both non-genetic factors and population admixture and observe that half of the cis-eQTLs are replicated in one or more of the populations. We highlight patterns of eQTL-sharing between populations, which are partially determined by population genetic relatedness, and discover significant sharing of eQTL effects between Asians, European-admixed, and African subpopulations. Specifically, we observe that both the effect size and the direction of effect for eQTLs are highly conserved across populations. We observe an increasing proximity of eQTLs toward the transcription start site as sharing of eQTLs among populations increases, highlighting that variants close to TSS have stronger effects and therefore are more likely to be detected across a wider panel of populations. Together these results offer a unique picture and resource of the degree of differentiation among human populations in functional regulatory variation and provide an estimate for the transferability of complex trait variants across populations.},

We report evidence of distorted transmission of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles in two independent schizophrenia family-based samples. In both samples, allelic association was dependent on the gender of the affected offspring, and in the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch/National Institute of Mental Health (CBDB/NIMH) sample it was also dependent on catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met genotype. Quantitative transmission disequilibrium test analyses revealed that variation in GAD1 influenced multiple domains of cognition, including declarative memory, attention and working memory. A 50 flanking SNP affecting cognition in the families was also associated in unrelated healthy individuals with inefficient BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging activation of dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) during a working memory task, a physiologic phenotype associated with schizophrenia and altered cortical inhibition. In addition, a SNP in the 50 untranslated (and predicted promoter) region that also influenced cognition was associated with decreased expression of GAD1 {mRNA} in the PFC of schizophrenic brain. Finally, we observed evidence of statistical epistasis between two SNPs in COMT and SNPs in GAD1, suggesting a potential biological synergism leading to increased risk. These coincident results implicate GAD1 in the etiology of schizophrenia and suggest that the mechanism involves altered cortical GABA inhibitory activity, perhaps modulated by dopaminergic function.}

  Abstract                 = {Entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) are lethal obligatory parasites of insects and are found in soils throughout the world. The recognition that these nematodes are major natural enemies of soil insect pests has stimulated research into various aspects of their biology and enabled their use in augmentation and conservation biological control programs. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the structure and dynamics of their populations or the factors that influence them. This knowledge is required if these nematodes are to fulfill their considerable potential as manageable components of cultivated ecosystems. The unusual life history of entomopathogenic nematodes imposes important constraints on their population biology. The host cadaver serves as the focus for many of the fundamental interactions associated with their population dynamics because feeding, development, mating, and reproduction are confined to the cadaver environment. Only non-feeding infective juveniles (dauer larvae) leave the host, but their production, dispersal, persistence, and infection potential provide critical links for the survival and proliferation of populations. Infective juveniles also carry symbiotic bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) that are released within the host, are largely responsible for host death, and form an integral part of their life history. In this paper, we discuss the structure of entomopathogenic nematode populations, the various biotic and abiotic factors that influence them, and procedures for sampling and modeling their spatial and temporal dynamics. Environmental degradation and the economic and social realities of modern agriculture assure that entomopathogenic nematodes will remain prime subjects for continuing basic and applied ecological research.

Genetic mapping based on high-resolution maps saturated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms or microsatellites is now providing effective strategies for discovering candidate genes determining important parasite phenotypes. Here we review classical linkage studies using laboratory crosses and population associations that are now amenable to genome-wide approaches and are revealing multiple candidate genes involved in complex drug responses. Moreover, mapping by linkage disequilibrium is practicable in cases where chromosomal segments flanking drug-selected genes have been preserved in populations during relatively recent P. falciparum evolution. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these various genetic mapping strategies, results from which offer complementary insights to those emerging from gene knockout experiments and/or high-throughput genomic technologies. },

It is usually 260-270 amino acids long and its binding to the large-subunit ribosomal RNA near the peptidyl transferase center is mediated by a beta-barrel RNA-binding domain with 10 beta strands. In the diverse land plants Marchantia polymorpha (liverwort) and Oryza sativa (rice), the mitochondrial-encoded L2 ribosomal protein is about 500 amino acids long owing to a centrally located expansion containing the beta 3-beta 4 strand region. We have determined that, in wheat, the functional rp12 gene has been transferred to the nucleus and much of the plant-specific internal insert has been deleted. Its mRNA is only 1.2 kb, and two expressed copies in wheat encode proteins of 318 and 319 amino acids, so they are considerably shorter than the maize nuclear-located rp12 gene of 448 codons. Comparative sequence analysis of cereal mitochondrial L2 ribosomal proteins indicates that the mid region has undergone unexpectedly rapid evolution during the last 60 million years.},

Simulations of a blowfly population exhibit cyclic fluctuations, whereas a simulated squirrel population reaches a stable age distribution and stable equilibrium population size. Life-history attributes are easily studied from the computed solutions, and are discussed for these examples. Recovery of a stressed population back to equilibrium is examined by computing the transition in age structure, and the transient behavior of other properties of the population such as the per capita growth rate, the average age, and the generation length.},

  Abstract                 = {Peptides Count (SC) was widely used for protein abundance estimation in proteomics On the basis of that, Mann and co-workers corrected the SC by dividing spectrum counts by the number of observable peptides per protein and named it PAI. Here we present modified spectral count index (mSCI) for protein abundance estimation, which was defined as the number of observed peptides divided by protein relative identification possibility (RIPpro). RIPpro was derived from 6788 mRNA and protein expression data (collected from human liver samples) and related to proteins' three physical and chemical properties (MW/p//Hp). For 46 proteins in mouse neuro2a cells, mSCI shows a linear relationship with the actual protein concentration, similar or better than PAI abundance. Also, multiple linear regressions were performed to quantitative assess several factors' impact on the mRNA/protein abundance correlation. Our results shown that the primary factor affecting protein levels was mRNA abundance (32-37\%), followed by variability in protein measurement, MW and protein turnover (7-12\%,7-9\% and 2-3\%, respectively). Interestingly, we found that the concordance between mRNA transcripts and protein expression was not consistent among all protein functional categories This correlation was lower for signaling proteins as compared to metabolism genes. It was determined that RIPpro was the primary factor affecting signaling protein abundance (23\% on average), followed by mRNA abundance (17\%). In contrast, only 5\% (on average) of the variability of metabolic protein abundance was explained by RIPpro, much lower than mRNA abundance (40\%) These results provide the impetus for further investigation of the biological significance of mechanisms regulating the mRNA/protein abundance correlation and provide additional insight into the relative importance of the technological parameter (RIPpro) in mRNA/protein correlation research.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: There are a number of methods (also called: measures) currently in use that quantify codon usage in genes. These measures are often influenced by other sequence properties, such as length. This can introduce strong methodological bias into measurements; therefore we attempted to develop a method free from such dependencies. One of the common applications of codon usage analyses is to quantitatively predict gene expressivity. Results: We compared the performance of several commonly used measures and a novel method we introduce in this paper - Measure Independent of Length and Composition (MILC). Large, randomly generated sequence sets were used to test for dependence on (i) sequence length, (ii) overall amount of codon bias and (iii) codon bias discrepancy in the sequences. A derivative of the method, named MELP (MILC-based Expression Level Predictor) can be used to quantitatively predict gene expression levels from genomic data. It was compared to other similar predictors by examining their correlation with actual, experimentally obtained {mRNA} or protein abundances. Conclusion: We have established that MILC is a generally applicable measure, being resistant to changes in gene length and overall nucleotide composition, and introducing little noise into measurements. Other methods, however, may also be appropriate in certain applications. Our efforts to quantitatively predict gene expression levels in several prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes met with varying levels of success, depending on the experimental dataset and predictor used. Out of all methods, MELP and Rainer Merkl's GCB method had the most consistent behaviour. A 'reference set' containing known ribosomal protein genes appears to be a valid starting point for a codon usage-based expressivity prediction. },

  Abstract                 = {Synonymous codon usage varies both between organisms and among genes within a genome, and arises due to differences in G + C content, replication strand skew, or gene expression levels. Correspondence analysis (CA) is widely used to identify major sources of variation in synonymous codon usage among genes and provides a way to identify horizontally transferred or highly expressed genes. Four methods of CA have been developed based on three kinds of input data: absolute codon frequency, relative codon frequency, and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) as well as within-group CA (MICA). Although different CA methods have been used in the past, no comprehensive comparative study has been performed to evaluate their effectiveness. Here, the four CA methods were evaluated by applying them to 241 bacterial genome sequences. The results indicate that MICA is more effective than the other three methods in generating axes that reflect variations in synonymous codon usage. Furthermore, MICA reveals sources that were previously unnoticed in some genomes; e.g. synonymous codon usage related to replication strand skew was detected in Rickettsia prowazekii. Though CA based on RSCU is widely used, our evaluation indicates that this method does not perform as well as MICA.},

  Abstract                 = {In the study of molecular and phenotypic evolution, understanding the relative importance of random genetic drift and positive selection as the mechanisms for driving divergences between populations and maintaining polymorphisms within populations has been a central issue. A variety of statistical methods has been developed for detecting natural selection operating at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence levels. These methods may be largely classified into those aimed at detecting recurrent and/or recent/ongoing natural selection by utilizing the divergence and/or polymorphism data. Using these methods, pervasive positive selection has been identified for protein-coding and non-coding sequences in the genomic analysis of some organisms. However, many of these methods have been criticized by using computer simulation and real data analysis to produce excessive false-positives and to be sensitive to various disturbing factors. Importantly, some of these methods have been invalidated experimentally. These facts indicate that many of the statistical methods for detecting natural selection are unreliable. In addition, the signals that have been believed as the evidence for fixations of advantageous mutations due to positive selection may also be interpreted as the evidence for fixations of deleterious mutations due to random genetic drift. The genomic diversity data are rapidly accumulating in various organisms, and detection of natural selection may play a critical role for clarifying the relative role of random genetic drift and positive selection in molecular and phenotypic evolution. It is therefore important to develop reliable statistical methods that are unbiased as well as robust against various disturbing factors, for inferring natural selection.},

We summarize the available data on this epidemic and use it to parameterize a stochastic compartmental model for an infection spreading through a spatial array of patches coupled by nearest-neighbour mixing, with replacement of susceptibles occurring as a discrete annual event. 3. A combination of analytical and simulation techniques is used to show that the high levels of transmission between different seal subpopulations, combined with the small annual birth cohort, act to make persistence of infection impossible in this harbour seal population at realistic population levels. The well known mechanisms by which metapopulation structures may act to promote persistence can be seen to have an effect only at weaker levels of spatial coupling, and higher levels of host recruitment, than those empirically observed.}

Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are long stretches of consecutive homozygous genotypes probably reflecting segments shared identically by descent as the result of processes such as consanguinity, population size reduction, and natural selection. The relationship between ROH and patterns of predicted deleterious variation can provide insight into the way in which these processes contribute to the maintenance of deleterious variants. Here, we use exome sequencing to examine ROH in relation to the distribution of deleterious variation in 27 individuals of varying levels of apparent inbreeding from 6 human populations. A significantly greater fraction of all genome-wide predicted damaging homozygotes fall in ROH than would be expected from the corresponding fraction of nondamaging homozygotes in ROH (p < 0.001). This pattern is strongest for long ROH (p < 0.05). ROH, and especially long ROH, harbor disproportionately more deleterious homozygotes than would be expected on the basis of the total ROH coverage of the genome and the genomic distribution of nondamaging homozygotes. The results accord with a hypothesis that recent inbreeding, which generates long ROH, enables rare deleterious variants to exist in homozygous form. Thus, just as inbreeding can elevate the occurrence of rare recessive diseases that represent homozygotes for strongly deleterious mutations, inbreeding magnifies the occurrence of mildly deleterious variants as well.},

The 95\% confidence interval of the age of the common ancestral mtDNA was estimated to be 80,000-480,000 years in humans and 0.57-2.72 Myr in common chimpanzees. },

  Abstract                 = {Drosophila melanogaster has been a canonical model organism to study genetics, development, behavior, physiology, evolution, and population genetics for nearly a century. Despite this emphasis and the completion of its nuclear genome sequence, the timing of major speciation events leading to the origin of this fruit fly remain elusive because of the paucity of extensive fossil records and biogeographic data. Use of molecular clocks as an alternative has been fraught with non-clock-like accumulation of nucleotide and amino-acid substitutions. Here we present a novel methodology in which genomic mutation distances are used to overcome these limitations and to make use of all available gene sequence data for constructing a fruit fly molecular time scale. Our analysis of 2977 pairwise sequence comparisons from 176 nuclear genes reveals a long-term fruit fly mutation clock ticking at a rate of 11.1 mutations per kilobase pair per Myr. Genomic mutation clock-based timings of the landmark speciation events leading to the evolution of D. melanogaster show that it shared most recent common ancestry 5.4 MYA with D. simulans, 12.6 MYA with D. erecta+D. orena, 12.8 MYA with D. yakuba+D. teisseri, 35.6 MYA with the takahashii subgroup, 41.3 MYA with the montium subgroup, 44.2 MYA with the ananassae subgroup, 54.9 MYA with the obscura group, 62.2 MYA with the willistoni group, and 62.9 MYA with the subgenus Drosophila. These and other estimates are compatible with those known from limited biogeographic and fossil records. The inferred temporal pattern of fruit fly evolution shows correspondence with the cooling patterns of paleoclimate changes and habitat fragmentation in the Cenozoic.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a maximum penalized-likelihood (MPL) method to estimate the fitnesses of amino acids and the distribution of selection coefficients (S = 2Ns) in protein-coding genes from phylogenetic data. This improves on a previous maximum-likelihood method. Various penalty functions are used to penalize extreme estimates of the fitnesses, thus correcting overfitting by the previous method. Using a combination of computer simulation and real data analysis, we evaluate the effect of the various penalties on the estimation of the fitnesses and the distribution of S. We show the new method regularizes the estimates of the fitnesses for small, relatively uninformative data sets, but it can still recover the large proportion of deleterious mutations when present in simulated data. Computer simulations indicate that as the number of taxa in the phylogeny or the level of sequence divergence increases, the distribution of S can be more accurately estimated. Furthermore, the strength of the penalty can be varied to study how informative a particular data set is about the distribution of S. We analyze three protein-coding genes (the chloroplast rubisco protein, mammal mitochondrial proteins, and an influenza virus polymerase) and show the new method recovers a large proportion of deleterious mutations in these data, even under strong penalties, confirming the distribution of S is bimodal in these real data. We recommend the use of the new MPL approach for the estimation of the distribution of S in species phylogenies of protein-coding genes.},

In addition to population-based methods, the distribution can be estimated from DNA sequence data by phylogenetic-based models. Previous models have generally found unimodal distributions where the probability mass is concentrated between mildly deleterious and nearly neutral mutations. Here we use a sitewise mutation-selection phylogenetic model to estimate the distribution of selection coefficients among novel and fixed mutations (substitutions) in a data set of 244 mammalian mitochondrial genomes and a set of 401 PB2 proteins from influenza. We find a bimodal distribution of selection coefficients for novel mutations in both the mitochondrial data set and for the influenza protein evolving in its natural reservoir, birds. Most of the mutations are strongly deleterious with the rest of the probability mass concentrated around mildly deleterious to neutral mutations. The distribution of the coefficients among substitutions is unimodal and symmetrical around nearly neutral substitutions for both data sets at adaptive equilibrium. About 0.5\% of the nonsynonymous mutations and 14\% of the nonsynonymous substitutions in the mitochondrial proteins are advantageous, with 0.5\% and 24\% observed for the influenza protein. Following a host shift of influenza from birds to humans, however, we find among novel mutations in PB2 a trimodal distribution with a small mode of advantageous mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {The ER protein tapasin (Tpn) forms a bridge between MHC class I H chain (HC)/beta(2)-microglobulin and the TAP peptide transporter. The function of this TAP-associated complex was unclear because it was reported that soluble Tpn that has lost TAP interaction would be fully competent in terms of peptide loading and Ag presentation. We found, however, that only wild-type human Tpn (hTpn), but not three soluble hTpn variants, a transmembrane domain point mutant of hTpn (L410-->F), wild-type mouse Tpn, nor a mouse-human Tpn hybrid, fully up-regulated peptide-dependent Bw4 epitopes when expressed in Tpn-deficient.220.B*4402 cells. Consistent with suboptimal peptide loading, the t(1/2) of class I molecules was considerably reduced in the presence of soluble hTpn, hTpn-L410F, and murine Tpn. Furthermore, eluted peptide spectra and the class I-mediated inhibition of NK clones showed distinct differences to the hTpn transfectant. Only wild-type hTpn efficiently recruited HC and calreticulin (Crt) into complexes with TAP and endoplasmic reticulum p57 (ERp57). The L410F mutant was defective in TAP association, but bound to class I molecules, Crt, and ERp57. Mouse Tpn associated with human TAP and ERp57 on the one hand, and with HC and Crt on the other, but failed to recruit normal amounts of HLA class I molecules into the TAP complex. We conclude that the loading with peptides conferring high stability requires the Tpn-mediated introduction of HC into the TAP complex, whereas the mere interaction with Tpn is not sufficient.},

Polymorphisms in the HLA-G promoter region have been associated with miscarriage and asthma, whereas expression levels have been associated with a wide range of pathologic conditions as well as survival of embryos after \emph{in vitro} fertilization and of organs after transplantation. Here, we characterize the sequence variation and haplotype structure of the HLA-G promoter and flanking sequences in 44 African Americans, 47 European Americans and 43 Han Chinese by haplotype-specific PCR and sequencing. In all three populations, we observed high levels of nucleotide variation, an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles, and a genealogy with two common haplotypes separated by deep branches, features that are suggestive of balancing selection acting in this region. Comparisons to HLA-A and a pseudogene, HLA-J, suggested that the observed pattern of sequence variation in the HLA-G promoter region is not likely due to other selected HLA genes. We suggest that the mechanism for this selection is related to the highly regulated expression pattern of HLA-G and that highand low-expressing promoters may be favored under temporally and/or spatially varying selective pressures. },

While previous theoretical studies of gene duplication have mainly focused on the gene silencing process after fixation, the process leading to fixation is even more important for segmental duplications, because the majority of duplications would be lost before reaching a significant frequency in a population. Here, by a series of computer simulations, we show that purifying selection against loss-of-function mutations increases the fixation probability of a new duplicate gene, especially when the gene is haplo-insufficient. Theoretically, the probability of simultaneous preservation of both duplicate genes becomes twice the loss-of-function mutation rate (u(c)) when the population size (N), the degree of dominance of mutations (h) and the recombination rate between the duplicate genes (c) are all sufficiently large (Nu(c)>1, h>0.1 and c>u(c)). The preservation probability declines rapidly with h and becomes 0 when h=0 (haplo-sufficiency). We infer that masking deleterious loss-of-function mutations give duplicate genes an immediate selective advantage and, together with effects of increased gene dosage, would predominantly determine the fates of the duplicate genes in the early phase of their evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: While the pathogenesis and epidemiology of tuberculosis are well studied, relatively little is known about the evolution of the infectious agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, especially at the within-host level. The insertion sequence IS6110 is a genetic marker that is widely used to track the transmission of tuberculosis between individuals. This and other markers may also facilitate our understanding of the disease within patients. Results: This article presents three lines of evidence supporting the action of positive selection on M. tuberculosis within patients. The arguments are based on a comparison between empirical findings from molecular epidemiology, and population genetic models of evolution. Under the hypothesis of neutrality of genotypes, 1) the mutation rate of the marker IS6110 is unusually high, 2) the time it takes for substitutions to occur within patients is too short, and 3) the amount of polymorphism within patients is too low. Conclusions: Empirical observations are explained by the action of positive selection during infection, or alternatively by very low effective population sizes. I discuss the possible roles of antibiotic treatment, the host immune system and extrapulmonary dissemination in creating opportunities for positive selection. }

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have found high frequencies of bacteria with increased genomic rates of mutation in both clinical and laboratory populations. These observations may seem surprising in light of earlier experimental and theoretical studies. Mutator genes (genes that elevate the genomic mutation rate) are likely to induce deleterious imitations and thus suffer an indirect selective disadvantage; at the same time, bacteria carrying them can increase in frequency only by generating beneficial mutations at other loci. When clone, carrying imitator genes are rare, however, these beneficial mutations are far more likely to arise in members of the much larger nonmutator population. How then can mutators become prevalent? To address this question, we develop a model of the population dynamics of bacteria confronted with ever-changing environments. Using analytical and simulation procedures, we explore the process by which initially rare mutator alleles can rise in frequency. We demonstrate that subsequent to a shift in environmental conditions, there will be relatively long periods of time during which the mutator subpopulation can produce a beneficial mutation before the ancestral subpopulations are eliminated. If the beneficial mutation arises early enough, the overall frequency of mutators will climb to a point higher than when the process began. The probability of producing a subsequent beneficial mutation will then also increase. In this manner, mutators can increase in frequency over successive selective sweeps. We discuss the implications and pre-dictions of these theoretical results in relation to antibiotic resistance and the evolution of mutation rates. }

We examine these three modes to discuss the relationships among cross-immunity, the basic reproductive rates of each strain, and the invasion of the new strain. Superinfection is more restrictive than coinfection in the proportion of parameters that allows invasion. The coinfection model is extended to allow haploid strains to undergo recombination within the host. We investigate the effects of recombination and cross-immunity on the invasion of new strains.

This identification has been made possible through the development of a number of genotyping technologies including spoligo-typing. Highly prevalent genotypes associated with outbreaks, such as the W-Beijing strain, are implicitly regarded as fast spreading. Here we present a quantitative method to identify "emerging" strains, those that are spreading faster than the background rate inferred from spoligotype data. The approach uses information about the mutation process specific to spoligotypes, combined with a model of both transmission and mutation. The core principle is that if two comparable strains have the same number of isolates, then the strain with fewer inferred mutation events must have spread faster if the mutation process is common. Applying this method to four different data sets, we find not only the W-Beijing strain, but also a number of other strains, to be emerging in this sense. Importantly, the strains that are identified as emerging are not simply those with the largest number of cases. The use of this method should facilitate the targeting of individual genotypes in intervention programs. }

We use an approximate Bayesian computational method in combination with a stochastic model of tuberculosis transmission and mutation of a molecular marker to estimate the net transmission rate, the doubling time, and the reproductive value of the pathogen. This method is applied to a published data set from San Francisco of tuberculosis genotypes based on the marker IS6110. The mutation rate of this marker has previously been studied, and we use those estimates to form a prior distribution of mutation rates in the inference procedure. The posterior point estimates of the key parameters of interest for these data are as follows: net transmission rate, 0.69/year [95\% credibility interval (C.I.) 0.38, 1.08]; doubling time, 1.08 years (95\% C.I. 0.64, 1.82); and reproductive value 3.4 (95\% C.I. 1.4, 79.7).

Such heterogeneity may be, for example, spatial, temporal or behavioral in form. Generally, models that include population subdivision have assumed that individuals are permanently assigned to given behavioral states represented by the subpopulations. We consider a simple epidemic model in which a behavioral trait affects disease transmission, and this trait may be transferred among hosts as a consequence of social interaction. This creates a situation where the frequencies of different behavioral traits and disease states as well as their associations may change over time. We consider the impact of the culturally transmitted trait on the criterion for initial spread of the disease. We also explore the evolution of cultural traits in response to pathogen dynamics and show some conditions under which behavioral traits that reduce transmission evolve. We find that behaviors increasing the risk of infection can also evolve when they are inherently favored or when there is sufficient clustering of contacts between like behaviors.

  Abstract                 = {P-element-induced recombination in Drosophila melanogaster occurs premeiotically. Recombinants are therefore expected to accumulate in the stem cells of the germline of P-element-carrying males. We show that both the recombination frequency and the incidence of ''clustering'' increase with the age of males carrying various P-element derivatives. The combination of end-deleted elements can lead to average recombination frequencies >50\% with individual instances of 100\% recombination. These elements also lowered the fertility of the carriers. We investigated these features by constructing an analytical and a computer simulation model of the course of events in the germline, incorporating the recently proposed hybrid element insertion (HEI) model of P-element activity. The model is able to predict extreme recombination levels, segregation ratio biases and lowered fertility through cell death in a single analysis. }

  Abstract                 = {Background: Infectious diseases are often studied by characterising the population structure of the pathogen using genetic markers. An unresolved problem is the effective quantification of the extent of transmission using genetic variation data from such pathogen isolates. Methods: It is important that transmission indices reflect the growth of the infectious population as well as account for the mutation rate of the marker and the effects of sampling. That is, while responding to this growth rate, indices should be unresponsive to the sample size and the mutation rate. We use simulation methods taking into account both the mutation and sampling processes to evaluate indices designed to quantify transmission of tuberculosis. Results: Previously proposed indices generally perform inadequately according to the above criteria, with the partial exception of the recently proposed Transmission-Mutation Index. Conclusion: Any transmission index needs to take into account mutation of the marker and the effects of sampling. Simple indices are unlikely to capture the full complexity of the underlying processes.}

This procedure makes assumptions about the underlying properties of the genetic marker used for fingerprinting. In particular, it requires that each fingerprint changes sufficiently slowly within an individual that isolates from separate individuals infected by the same strain will exhibit similar or identical fingerprints. We propose a model for the probability that an individual's fingerprint will change over a given period of time. We use this model together with published data in order to estimate the fingerprint change rate for IS6110 in human tuberculosis, obtaining a value of 0.0139 changes per copy per year. Although we focus on insertion sequences (IS), our method applies to other fingerprinting techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We suggest sampling intervals that produce the least error in estimates of the fingerprint change rate, as well as sample sizes that achieve specified levels of error in the estimate.

  Abstract                 = {Insertion sequence (IS) elements are bacterial genes that are able to transpose to different locations in the genome. These elements are often used in molecular epidemiology as genetic markers that track the spread of pathogens. Transposable elements have frequently been described as "selfish DNA" because they facilitate their own transposition, causing damage when they insert into coding regions, while contributing little if anything to the bacterial host. According to this hypothesis, the expansion of copy number of insertion sequences is opposed by negative selection against high copy numbers. From an alternative point of view, we might expect IS elements to intrinsically regulate transposition within cells, thereby limiting damage to their bacterial host. Here, we report evidence that the copy number of IS6110 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is controlled by selection against the element. We first construct 12 different models of marker change resulting from a combination of possible transposition functions and selective regimes. We then compute the Akaike Information Criterion for each model to identify the models that best explain data consisting of serial isolates of M. tuberculosis genotyped with IS6110. We find that the best performing models all include selection against the accumulation of copies. Specifically, our analysis points to the interaction of separate copies of the element causing lethal effects. We discuss the implications of these findings for genome evolution and molecular epidemiology. }

The genome of M, tuberculosis carries insertion sequences (IS6110) that are relatively stable over time periods of months but have an observable transposition rate over longer time scales. Variability in copy number and genomic location of (IS6110) can be harnessed to generate a DNA fingerprint for each strain, by digesting the genome with a restriction enzyme and using a portion of the element as a probe for Southern blots. The number of bands found for a given genome approximates the number of copies of IS6110 it carries. A large data set of such fingerprints from tuberculosis (TB) cases in San Francisco provides an observed distribution of IS6110 copy number. implementation of the model through deterministic and stochastic simulation indicates some general features of IS/TB dynamics, By comparing observations with outcomes of the model, we conclude that the IS/TB system is very heterogeneous and far from equilibrium. We find that the transposition parameters have a much stronger effect than the epidemic parameters on copy number distribution. }

Classifying these changes by their physicochemical properties has not been suitably effective in isolating the fastest evolving classes of changes. We now propose to use the Universal index U of Tang et al. (2004) to classify the 75 elementary amino acid changes (codons differing by 1 bp) by their evolutionary exchangeability. Let K-i denote the K-a value of each class (i = 1,..., 75 from the most to the least exchangeable). The cumulative Ki for the top 10 classes, denoted K-a, (for high-exchangeability types), has two important properties: (1) K-h usually accounts for 25\%-30\% of total amino acid changes and (2) when the observed number of amino acid substitutions is large, K-h is predictably twice the value of K-a.. This shall be referred to as the twofold approximation. The new method for estimating Kh is applied to the comparisons between human and macaque and between mouse and rat. The twofold approximation holds well in these data sets, and the signature of positive selection can be more easily discerned using the K-h statistic than using K-a. Many genes with Ka/K-s > 0.5 can now be shown to have K-h/K-s > 1 and to have evolved adaptively, at least for the high-exchangeability group of amino acid changes. },

  Abstract                 = {New pathogens and antimicrobial-resistant forms of older pathogens continue to emerge, some with the potential for rapid, global spread and high morbidity and mortality. Pathogens can emerge either through introduction into a new population or when the interaction with the vector changes; emergence is also influenced by microbiological adaptation and change, global travel patterns, domestic and wild animal contact and other variants in human ecology and behaviour. Quick, decisive action to detect and control novel pathogens, and thereby contain outbreaks and prevent further transmission, is frequently hampered by incomplete or inadequate data about a new or re-emerging pathogen. Three examples of pathogens that are current causes for human health concern are avian influenza, West Nile virus (WNV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Pathogens directly or indirectly transmitted by aerosolized droplets, such as avian influenza and SARS, pose considerable containment challenges. Rapid screening tests for other newly described pathogens such as WNV require time for development and may be < 100\% reliable. The importance of vigilance in the detection and control of newly recognized infectious threats cannot be overstressed. The presence of infectious agents in the blood supply could again have a significant impact on the safe use of both blood and blood-derived products in the care of patients with haemophilia, as did the human immunodeficiency virus in the 1980s. Emerging pathogens will continue to be a reality requiring the collaborative efforts of public health and individual healthcare providers worldwide to contain outbreaks and prevent transmission.}

He reiterated this point a few years later in proposing that without duplicated genes the creation of metazoans, vertebrates, and mammals from unicellular organisms would have been impossible. Such big leaps in evolution, he argued, required the creation of new gene loci with previously nonexistent functions (98). Bold statements such as these, combined with his proposal that at least one whole-genome duplication event facilitated the evolution of vertebrates, have made Ohno an icon in the literature on genome evolution. However, discussion on the occurrence and consequences of gene and genome duplication events has a much longer, and often neglected, history. Here we review literature dealing with the occurence and consequences of gene duplication, begining in 1911. We document conceptual and technological advances in gene duplication research from this early research in comparative cytology up to recent research on whole genomes, "transcriptomes," and "interactomes.". },

The first two gaps should be kept open; the others should be bridged or the difficulty of doing so should be acknowledged: 1. Key terms have multiple meanings that are distinct; 2. Statistical patterns are distinct from measurable underlying factors; 3. Translation from statistical analyses to hypotheses about measurable factors is difficult; 4. Predictions based on extrapolations from existing patterns of variation may not match outcomes; 5. The partitioning of variation in human studies does not reliably estimate the intended quantities; 6. Translation from statistical analyses to hypotheses about the measurable factors is even more difficult in light of the possible heterogeneity of underlying genetic or environmental factors; 7. Many steps lie between the analysis of observed traits and interventions based on well-founded claims about the causal influence of genetic or environmental factors; 8. Explanation of variation within groups does not translate to explanation of differences among groups. At the start, I engage readers' attention with three puzzles that have not been resolved by past debates. The puzzles concern generational increases in IQ test scores, the possibility of underlying heterogeneity, and the translation of methods from selective breeding into human genetics. After discussing the gaps, I present each puzzle in a new light and point to several new puzzles that invite attention from analysts of variation in quantitative genetics and in social science more generally.

  Abstract                 = {Starting with "mitochondrial Eve" in 1987, genetics has played an increasingly important role in studies of the last two million years of human evolution. It initially appeared that genetic data resolved the basic models of recent human evolution in favor of the "out-of-Africa replacement" hypothesis in which anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa about 150,000 years ago, started to spread throughout the world about 100,000 years ago, and subsequently drove to complete genetic extinction (replacement) all other human populations in Eurasia. Unfortunately, many of the genetic studies on recent human evolution have suffered from scientific flaws, including misrepresenting the models of recent human evolution, focusing upon hypothesis compatibility rather than hypothesis testing, committing the ecological fallacy, and failing to consider a broader array of alternative hypotheses. Once these flaws are corrected, there is actually little genetic support for the out-of-Africa replacement hypothesis. Indeed, when genetic data are used in a hypothesis-testing framework, the out-of-Africa replacement hypothesis is strongly rejected. The model of recent human evolution that emerges from a statistical hypothesis-testing framework does not correspond to any of the traditional models of human evolution, but it is compatible with fossil and archaeological data. These studies also reveal that any one gene or DNA region captures only a small part of human evolutionary history, so multilocus studies are essential. As more and more loci became available, genetics will undoubtedly offer additional insights and resolutions of human evolution.},

There are two fundamental reasons for this abject failure as follows: 1) studies have been inadequately designed to identify such genetic risk factors; 2) the genetic factors that do exist are individually of small marginal importance, and are characterized by extensive heterogeneity. If 2) is the truth, there is little we can do about it, so we emphasize the importance of 1) in this article, while recognizing that 2) probably is not far from the truth. Genetic studies, in contrast to epidemiological studies, use confounding and ascertainment bias to help identify weak etiologic signal due to genes, since gene mapping is fundamentally a hypothesis-free science. This strategy makes it possible to identify genetic risk factors, but makes it impossible to quantify the size of their effect on risk. Classical epidemiological study designs are of minimal value for gene identification, but may be of use in estimation of the effect size of genetic risk factors once they are identified in more appropriately designed genetic studies. However, if the effects are so weak that we need this strong, systematic ascertainment bias to find them, their relevance to public health may be of questionable immediate value, raising many questions about the rhetoric and promises being made to the public as justification for 'big science' approaches to dissecting the hypothetical role of genes in complex traits.},

  Abstract                 = {Rare codons and their effects in heterologous protein expression in \emph{Escherichia coli} were addressed by many investigators. Here, we propose that not all rare codons of a foreign gene have negative effect but selective codon among them and its specific position in the downstream of the start codon modulates the expression. In our study, streptokinase (47 kDa), encoded by skc gene of Streptococcus equisimilis was expressed in E.coli. The analysis of relative codon frequency of skc gene in E.coli reveals the presence of 30\% of rare codons in it. Nevertheless, E.coli managed to yield over-expression of this target protein. To explore the codon bias in expression, we have introduced the selective AGG codon at different positions of skc gene such as +2,+3,+5,+8,+9 and +11. The results revealed that at +2 position "AGG" aided overexpression while shifting to +3 and +5 positions it rendered nil expression. In contrary, shifting of AGG codon to later positions like +9 and +11 the inhibitory effect was reversed and resulted in over-expression. The effect of 'AGG' rare codon was further studied in GFP expression. In conclusion, besides the choice of rare codons, their precise positions in the foreign gene dictate the level of protein expression. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. },

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of the complete genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirms and extends earlier evidence that a majority of yeast genes are not essential, at least under laboratory conditions. Many fail to yield a discernible mutant phenotype even when disrupted. Genes not subject to natural selection would accumulate inactivating mutations, so these "cryptic" genes must have functions that are overlooked by the standard methods of yeast genetics. Two explanations seem possible: (i) They have important functions only in environments not yet duplicated in the laboratory and would have conditional phenotypes if tested appropriately. (ii) They make small, but significant, contributions to fitness even under routine growth conditions, but the effects are not large enough to be detected by conventional methods. We have tested the second "marginal benefit" hypothesis by measuring the fitnesses of a random collection of disruption mutants in direct competition with their wild-type progenitor. A substantial majority of mutant strains that lack obvious defects nevertheless are at a significant selective disadvantage just growing on rich medium under normal conditions. This result has important implications for efforts to understand the functions of novel genes revealed by sequencing projects.},

We also discuss how such knowledge is important to understanding several aspects of the current problems faced by humanity in our changing world and to predicting the long-term consequences of parasite eradication policies on our health and well-being.

The importance of having the rate at which a point mutation occurs depend on the DNA sequence at sites surrounding the mutation is now better appreciated and can be accommodated in probabilistic models of protein evolution. To quantify the evolutionary impact of some aspect of phenotype, one promising strategy is to develop a system for predicting phenotype from the DNA sequence and to then infer how the evolutionary rates of sequence change are affected by the predicted phenotypic consequences of the changes. Although statistical tools for characterizing protein evolution are improving, the list of candidate phenomena that can affect rates of protein evolution is long and the relative contributions of these phenomena are only beginning to be disentangled.},

Recent models of sequence change use in silico prediction systems to incorporate the effects of phenotype on evolutionary rates. These models have been designed for analyzing sequence data from different species and have been accompanied by statistical techniques for estimating model parameters when the incorporation of phenotype induces dependent change among sequence positions. A difficulty with these efforts to link phenotype and interspecific evolution is that evolution occurs within populations, and parameters of interspecific models should have population genetic interpretations. We show, with two examples, how population genetic interpretations can be assigned to evolutionary models. The first example considers the impact of RNA secondary structure on sequence change, and the second reflects the tendency for protein tertiary structure to influence nonsynonymous substitution rates. We argue that statistical fit to data should not be the sole criterion for assessing models of sequence change. A good interspecific model should also yield a clear and biologically plausible population genetic interpretation.},

Broadly virulent pathogens occurred more frequently in highly resistant host populations, whereas avirulent pathogens dominated susceptible populations. Experimental inoculations indicated a negative trade-off between spore production and virulence. The nonrandom spatial distribution of pathogens, maintained through time despite high pathogen mobility, implies that selection favors virulent strains of Melampsora lini in resistant Linum marginale populations and avirulent strains in susceptible populations. These results are consistent with gene-for-gene models of host-pathogen coevolution that require trade-offs to prevent pathogen virulence increasing until host resistance becomes selectively neutral.}

  Abstract                 = {\emph{Escherichia coli} is a model organism for biochemical and biological studies as it is one of the best characterised prokaryote. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, computer image analysis and different protein identification techniques gave rise, in 1995, to the Escherichia coli SWISS-2D PAGE database (http://www. expasy.ch/ch2d/). in the E. coli 3.5-10 SWISS-2D PAGE map, 40\% of the E. coli proteome was displayed. The present study demonstrated that the use of narrow range pH gradients is able to potentially display up to a few copies of protein per E. coli cell. Moreover, the six new E. coli SWISS-2D PAGE maps (pH 4-5, 4.5-5.5, 5-6, 5.5-6.7, 69 and 6-11) presented here displayed altogether more than 70\% of the entire E. coli proteome.},

Application to yeast SH3 domains generated a phage-display network containing 394 interactions among 206 proteins and a two-hybrid network containing 233 interactions among 145 proteins. Graph theoretic analysis identified 59 highly likely interactions common to both networks, Las17 (Bee1), a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) family of actin-assembly proteins, showed multiple SH3 interactions, many of which were confirmed \emph{in vivo} by coimmunoprecipitation.},

  Abstract                 = {Anthelmintic resistance has become an increasing problem particularly to gastrointestinal tract nematodes and appropriate methods are required to detect this phenomenon so the correct action can be taken. This paper compares a number of mathematical techniques that are used to analyse data. The negative binomial distribution is a mathematical distribution used to model aggregated data and hence is suitable to model the intensity of parasite burden and the magnitude of the faecal egg counts. Maximum likelihood techniques are utilised to exploit this mathematical distribution to analyse the magnitude of the faecal egg count reduction and decline in the worm burden in response to anthelmintic treatment. Data from experimental groups of sheep described in the accompanying paper are used. In addition, simulated data sets of faecal egg counts were created using a random number generator following appropriate negative binomial distributions. The results demonstrate this statistical model can detect evidence of anthelmintic resistance with a faecal egg reduction test that otherwise might require a slaughter trial to demonstrate. In addition, the simulated data sets confirm that there is a significant probability of failure to detect low anthelmintic efficacy with commonly used mathematical techniques. Consequently, the use of maximum likelihood mathematical techniques with a negative binomial statistical model would aid in the early detection of anthelmintic resistance using faecal egg count reductions and result in a lower probability of inappropriately assigning an anthelmintic as effective.

  Abstract                 = {The expanded CAG tract diseases are a heterogeneous group of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of insoluble protein material and premature neuronal cell death. Recent work has provided support for several mechanisms that may account for neurodegeneration, but no unifying mechanism has emerged. We have previously demonstrated that in SCA3, the expanded CAG tract in the MJD-1 transcript is prone to frameshifting, which may lead to the production of polyalanine-containing proteins. To further examine the occurrence of frameshifting and understand its mechanism and possible role in pathogenesis, a cellular model was established. We show that this phenomenon results from ribosomal slippage to the -1 frame exclusively, that ribosomal frameshifting depends on the presence of long CAG tracts and that polyalanine-frameshifted proteins may enhance polyglutamine-associated toxicity, possibly contributing to pathogenesis. Finally, we present evidence that anisomycin, a ribosome-interacting drug that reduces -1 frameshifting, also reduces toxicity, suggesting a new therapeutic opportunity for these disorders.},

In particular, explanations of TE autorepression at high copy number that invoke a decrease in number of active monomers through dimerization, amyloidization, and protein-{mRNA} binding to create an inactive state are not supported by analysis of the corresponding kinetic models. This is also true for similar {mRNA}-{mRNA} binding models. Self-repression in mariner as well as other TEs can, however, be explained by a host-independent model in which inactive dimers compete with monomers for TE binding sites at the ends of the element. This model would also allow heterodimer poisoning to down-regulate transposition in the presence of divergent nonautonomous elements, since nondivergent monomers would be required at both TE ends for transposition.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To explore lay perceptions about medicine and drug therapy (including gene-based therapy) in the present and in the future. BACKGROUND: Following almost a year of national debate, the Icelandic parliament passed the Health Sector Database (HSD) Act in 1998. No single issue has been as much debated in Iceland as this database. Despite the explosion of popular and scientific literature in the field of bioethics, there is still a paucity of research concerning 'lay' contributions to the debates. METHODS: The study was designed as a qualitative study. Focus groups (FGs) were conducted followed by one-on-one interviews with the FG moderator. Participants were asked to comment on a future scenario consisting of predictions concerning the consequence of the Human Genome Project over the next 40 years. Participants: Forty-two persons participated in eight FGs in Iceland. The Icelandic moderator was interviewed in English after each group. CONCLUSIONS: The lay public was relatively optimistic with regard to the future of drugs and gene-based therapy. Reasons for this optimism can be found in a basic trust and belief in the welfare state and the health system. These results are not consistent with studies carried out in other countries where the public appears to be focused on the negative effects of genetic research and the threats to privacy. Most participants expressed concern about potential problems with regard to social and equity issues, whereas the HSD controversy, a discourse based on the rhetoric of bioethics, was at variance with the issues focused on by the lay public.},

  Abstract                 = {How can we understand a case in which a given amino acid sequence folds into structurally and functionally distinct molecules? Synonymous single-nucleoticle polymorphisms in the MDR1 (multidrug resistance 1 or ABCB1) gene involving frequent-to-rare codon substitutions lead to identical protein sequences. Remarkably, these alternative sequences give a protein product with similar but different structures and functions. Here, we propose that long-enough ribosomal pause time scales may lead to alternate folding pathways and distinct minima on the folding free energy surface. While the conformational and functional differences between the native and alternate states may be minor, the MDR1 case illustrates that the barriers may nevertheless constitute sufficiently high hurdles in physiological time scales, leading to kinetically trapped states with altered structures and functions. Different folding pathways leading to conformationally similar trapped states may be due to swapping of (fairly symmetric) segments. Domain swapping is more likely in the no-pause case in which the chain elongates and folds simultaneously; on the other hand, sufficiently long pause times between such segments may be expected to lessen the chances of swapping events. Here, we review the literature in this light. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Most microbes have complex life cycles with multiple modes of reproduction that differ in their effects on DNA sequence variation. Population genomic analyses can therefore be used to estimate the relative frequencies of these different modes in nature. The life cycle of the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus is complex, including clonal reproduction, outcrossing, and two different modes of inbreeding. To quantify these different aspects we analyzed DNA sequence variation in the third chromosome among 20 isolates from two populations. Measures of mutational and recombinational diversity were used to make two independent estimates of the population size. In an obligately sexual population these values should be approximately equal. Instead there is a discrepancy of about three orders of magnitude between our two estimates of population size, indicating that S. paradoxus goes through a sexual cycle approximately once in every 1,000 asexual generations. Chromosome III also contains the mating type locus (MAT), which is the most outbred part in the entire genome, and by comparing recombinational diversity as a function of distance from MAT we estimate the frequency of matings to be approximate to 94\% from within the same tetrad, 5\% with a clonemate after switching the mating type, and 1\% outcrossed. Our study illustrates the utility of population genomic data in quantifying life cycles. },

  Abstract                 = {Summary: Recent years have seen intensive progress in measuring protein translation. However, the contributions of coding sequences to the efficiency of the process remain unclear. Here, we identify a universally conserved profile of translation efficiency along mRNAs computed based on adaptation between coding sequences and the tRNA pool. In this profile, the first ~30-50 codons are, on average, translated with a low efficiency. Additionally, in eukaryotes, the last ~50 codons show the highest efficiency over the full coding sequence. The profile accurately predicts position-dependent ribosomal density along yeast genes. These data suggest that translation speed and, as a consequence, ribosomal density are encoded by coding sequences and the tRNA pool. We suggest that the slow ramp at the beginning of mRNAs serves as a late stage of translation initiation, forming an optimal and robust means to reduce ribosomal traffic jams, thus minimizing the cost of protein expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome and not yet folded may at least transiently present degradation signals similar to those recognized by the ubiquitin system in misfolded proteins. The ubiquitin sandwich technique was used to detect and measure cotranslational protein degradation in living cells. More than 50 percent of nascent protein molecules bearing an amino-terminal degradation signal can be degraded cotranslationally, never reaching their mature size before their destruction by processive proteolysis. Thus, the folding of nascent proteins, including abnormal ones, may be in kinetic competition with pathways that target these proteins for degradation cotranslationally.},

In one approach, we constructed a protein array of about 6,000 yeast transformants, with each transformant expressing one of the open reading frames as a fusion to an activation domain. This array was screened by a simple and automated procedure for 192 yeast proteins, with positive responses identified by their positions in the array, in a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins, These data reveal interactions that place functionally unclassified proteins in a biological context, interactions between proteins involved in the same biological function, and interactions that link biological functions together into larger cellular processes. The results of these screens are shown here.},

  Abstract                 = {The apparently large genetic contribution to the aetiology of mental illness presents a formidable puzzle. Unlike common physical disorders, mental illness usually has an onset early in the reproductive age and is associated with substantial reproductive disadvantage. Therefore, genetic variants associated with vulnerability to mental illness should be under strong negative selection pressure and be eliminated from the genetic pool through natural selection. Still, mental disorders are common and twin studies indicate a strong genetic contribution to their aetiology. Several theories have been advanced to explain the paradox of high heritability and reproductive disadvantage associated with the same common phenotype, but none provides a satisfactory explanation for all types of mental illness. At the same time, identification of the molecular substrate underlying the large genetic contribution to the aetiology of mental illness is proving more difficult than expected. The quest for genetic variants associated with vulnerability to mental illness is predicated upon the common disease/common variant (CDCV) hypothesis. On the basis of a summary of evidence, it is concluded that the CDCV hypothesis is untenable for most types of mental illness. An alternative evolution-informed framework is proposed, which suggests that gene-environment interactions and rare genetic variants constitute most of the genetic contribution to mental illness. Common mental illness with mild reproductive disadvantage is likely to have a large contribution from interactions between common genetic variants and environmental exposures. Severe mental illness that confers strong reproductive disadvantage is likely to have a large and pleiotropic contribution from rare variants of recent origin. This framework points to a need for a paradigm change in genetic research to enable major progress in elucidating the aetiology of mental illness.

  Abstract                 = {In numerous species, from bacteria to Drosophila, evidence suggests that selection acts even on synonymous codon usage: codon bias is greater in more abundantly expressed genes, the rate of synonymous evolution is lower in genes with greater codon bias, and there is consistency between genes in the same species in which codons are preferred. In contrast, in mammals, while nonequal use of alternative codons is observed, the bias is attributed to the background variance in nucleotide concentrations, reflected in the similar nucleotide composition of flanking noncoding and exonic third sites. However. a systematic examination of the covariants of codon usage controlling for background nucleotide content has yet to be performed. Here we present a new method to measure codon bias that corrects for background nucleotide content and apply this to 2396 human genes, Nearly all (99\%) exhibit a higher amount of codon bias than expected by chance. The patterns associated with selectively driven codon bias are weakly recovered: Broadly expressed genes have a higher level of bias than do tissue-specific genes, the bias is higher for genes with lower rates of synonymous substitutions, and certain codons are repeatedly preferred. However, while these patterns are suggestive, the first two patterns appear to be methodological artifacts. The last pattern reflects in part biases in usage of nucleotide pairs. We conclude that we find no evidence for selection on codon usage in humans. },

In contrast, in species with large population sizes, selection is expected to be a much more effective force. Evidence for this has come from examining how genic parameters vary with expression level, which appears to determine many of a gene's features, such as codon bias, amino acid composition, and size. However, not until now has it been possible to examine whether human genes show the signature of selection mediated by expression level. Here, then, to investigate this issue, we gathered expression data for >10,000 human genes from public data sets obtained by different technologies (SAGE and high-density oligonucleotide chip arrays) and compared them with gene parameters. We find that, even after controlling for regional effects, highly expressed genes code for smaller proteins, have less intronic DNA, and higher codon and amino acid biases. We conclude that, contrary to the usual supposition, human genes show signatures consistent with selection mediated by expression level.},

  Abstract                 = {For a given regression problem it is possible to identify a suitably defined equivalent two-sample problem such that the power or sample size obtained for the two-sample problem also applies to the regression problem. For a standard linear regression model the equivalent two-sample problem is easily identified, but for generalized linear models and for Cox regression models the situation is more complicated. An approximately equivalent two-sample problem may, however, also be identified here. In particular, we show that for logistic regression and Cox regression models the equivalent two-sample problem is obtained by selecting two equally sized samples for which the parameters differ by a value equal to the slope times twice the standard deviation of the independent variable and further requiring that the overall expected number of events is unchanged. In a simulation study we examine the validity of this approach to power calculations in logistic regression and Cox regression models. Several different covariate distributions are considered for selected values of the overall response probability and a range of alternatives. For the Cox regression model we consider both constant and non-constant hazard rates. The results show that in general the approach is remarkably accurate even in relatively small samples. Some discrepancies are, however, found in small samples with few events and a highly skewed covariate distribution. Comparison with results based on alternative methods for logistic regression models with a single continuous covariate indicates that the proposed method is at least as good as its competitors. The method is easy to implement and therefore provides a simple way to extend the range of problems that can be covered by the usual formulas for power and sample size determination.

  Abstract                 = {An ''adaptive dynamics'' modelling approach to the evolution of dominance-recessivity is presented. In this approach, fitness derives from an explicit ecological scenario, and both evolutionary attractivity and invasibility of resident populations are examined. The ecology consists of a within-individual part representing a locus with regulated activity and a between-individual part that is a two-patch soft selection model. Evolutionary freedom is allowed at a single locus. The evolutionary analysis considers directed random walks on trait space, generated by repeated invasions of mutants. the phenotype of an individual is determined by allelic parameters. Mutations can have two effects: they either affect the affinity of the promoter sequence for transcription factors, or they affect the gene product. The dominance interaction between alleles derives from their promoter affinities. Additive genetics is evolutionarily unstable when selection and evolution maintain two alleles in the population. In such a situation, dominance interactions can become stationary and close to additive genetics or they continue to evolve at a very slow pace towards dominance-recessivity. The probability that a specific dominance interaction will evolve depends on the relative mutation rate of promoter compared to gene product and the distribution of mutational effect sizes. Either allele in the dimorphism can become dominant, and dominance-recessivity is always most likely to evolve. Evolution then approaches a population state where every phenotype has maximum viability in one of the two patches. When the within-individual part is replaced by a housekeeping locus that codes for a metabolic enzyme, evolution favours a population of two alleles under the same conditions as for a regulated locus. In the case of a housekeeping gene, however, the evolutionary dynamical system approaches a population state where the heterozygote and only one homozygote phenotype are equivalent to the optimum phenotypes in the two patches.

  Abstract                 = {An evolutionary dynamical system with explicit diploid genetics is used to investigate the likelihood of observing phenotypically overdominant heterozygotes versus heterozygous phenotypes that are intermediate between the homozygotes. In this model, body size evolves in a population with discrete demographic episodes and with competition limiting reproduction. A genotype-phenotype map for body size is used that can generate the two qualitative types of dominance interactions (overdominance versus intermediate dominance). It is written as a single-locus model with one focal locus and parameters summarizing the effects of alleles at other loci. Two types of evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS; continuously stable strategy, CSS) occur. The ESS is generated either (1) by the population ecology; or (2) by a local maximum of the genotype-phenotype map. Overdominant heterozygotes are expected to arise if the population evolves toward the second type of ESS, where nearly maximum body sizes are found. When other loci with partially dominant inheritance also evolve, the location of the maximum in the genotype-phenotype map repeatedly changes. It is unlikely that an evolving population will track these changes; ESSs of the second type now are at best quasi-stationary states of the evolutionary dynamics. Considering the restrictions on its probability, a pattern of phenotypic overdominance is expected to be rare.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested that fish have more genes than humans. Whether most of these additional genes originated through a complete (fish-specific) genome duplication or through many lineage-specific tandem gene or smaller block duplications and family expansions continues to be debated. We analyzed the complete genome of the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes (Fugu) and compared it with the paranome of humans. We show that most paralogous genes of Fugu are the result of three complete genome duplications. Both relative and absolute dating of the complete predicted set of protein-coding genes suggest that initial genome duplications, estimated to have occurred at least 600 million years ago, shaped the genome of all vertebrates. In addition, analysis of >150 block duplications in the Fugu genome clearly supports a fish-specific genome duplication (approximately equal to 320 million years ago) that coincided with the vast radiation of most modern ray-finned fishes. Unlike the human genome, Fugu contains very few recently duplicated genes; hence, many human genes are much younger than fish genes. This lack of recent gene duplication, or, alternatively, the accelerated rate of gene loss, is possibly one reason for the drastic reduction of the genome size of Fugu observed during the past 100 million years or so, subsequent to the additional genome duplication that ray-finned fishes but not land vertebrates experienced.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: An important challenge for transcript counting methods such as Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), "Digital Northern" or Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS), is to carry out statistical analyses that account for the within-class variability, i.e., variability due to the intrinsic biological differences among sampled individuals of the same class, and not only variability due to technical sampling error. Results: We introduce a Bayesian model that accounts for the within-class variability by means of mixture distribution. We show that the previously available approaches of aggregation in pools ("pseudo-libraries") and the Beta-Binomial model, are particular cases of the mixture model. We illustrate our method with a brain tumor vs. normal comparison using SAGE data from public databases. We show examples of tags regarded as differentially expressed with high significance if the within-class variability is ignored, but clearly not so significant if one accounts for it. Conclusion: Using available information about biological replicates, one can transform a list of candidate transcripts showing differential expression to a more reliable one. Our method is freely available, under GPL/GNU copyleft, through a user friendly web-based on-line tool or as R language scripts at supplemental web-site. },

We show that these biases can arise generically from an instability of the coevolutionary dynamics between genome composition and resource allocation for translation, transcription, and replication. Thus, we offer a unifying framework for understanding and analyzing different genome biases. We develop a test of multistability of nucleotide composition of completely sequenced genomes and reveal a bistability for Borrelia burgdorferi, a genome with pronounced replication-related biases. These results indicate that evolution generates rhetoric, it improves the efficiency of the genome's communication with the cell without modifying the message, and this leads to bias.},

  Abstract                 = {An RNA virus population does not consist of a single genotype; rather, it is an ensemble of related sequences, termed quasispecies(1-4). Quasispecies arise from rapid genomic evolution powered by the high mutation rate of RNA viral replication(5-8). Although a high mutation rate is dangerous for a virus because it results in nonviable individuals, it has been hypothesized that high mutation rates create a 'cloud' of potentially beneficial mutations at the population level, which afford the viral quasispecies a greater probability to evolve and adapt to new environments and challenges during infection(4,9-11). Mathematical models predict that viral quasispecies are not simply a collection of diverse mutants but a group of interactive variants, which together contribute to the characteristics of the population(4,12). According to this view, viral populations, rather than individual variants, are the target of evolutionary selection(4,12). Here we test this hypothesis by examining the consequences of limiting genomic diversity on viral populations. We find that poliovirus carrying a high-fidelity polymerase replicates at wild-type levels but generates less genomic diversity and is unable to adapt to adverse growth conditions. In infected animals, the reduced viral diversity leads to loss of neurotropism and an attenuated pathogenic phenotype. Notably, using chemical mutagenesis to expand quasispecies diversity of the high-fidelity virus before infection restores neurotropism and pathogenesis. Analysis of viruses isolated from brain provides direct evidence for complementation between members in the quasispecies, indicating that selection indeed occurs at the population level rather than on individual variants. Our study provides direct evidence for a fundamental prediction of the quasispecies theory and establishes a link between mutation rate, population dynamics and pathogenesis. }

We extended these manipulations to analyze all features of male-specific behavior, including courtship song, which was almost eliminated by driving shi(TS) at high temperature. In the context of singing defects and homosexual courtship affected by mutations in the fru gene, a tra-regulated component of the sex-determination hierarchy, we found a C309/tra(F) combination also to induce high levels of courtship between pairs of males and "chaining" behavior in groups; however, these doubly transgenic males sang normally. Because production of male-specific FRU(M) protein is regulated by TRA, we hypothesized that a fru-derived transgene encoding the male (M) form of an Inhibitory RNA (fru(MIR)) would mimic the effects of tra(F); but C309/fru(MIR) males exhibited no courtship chaining, although they courted other males in single-pair tests. Double-labeling of neurons in which GFP was driven by C309 revealed that 10 of the 20 CNS clusters containing FRU(M) in wild-type males included coexpressing neurons. Histological analysis of the developing CNS could not rationalize the absence of tra(F) or fru(MIR) effects on courtship song, because we found C309 to be coexpressed with FRU(M) within the same 10 neuronal clusters in pupae. Thus, we hypothesize that elimination of singing behavior by the C309/shi(TS) combination involves neurons acting downstream of FRU(M) cells.},

Sequences of those eukaryotic cytoplasmic riboproteins that have orthologs in both Bacteria and Archaea. exclusively match the archacal block structure. The distinct blocks do not correlate consistently with any identifiable functional or structural feature including RNA and protein contacts. This phylodomain-specific block pattern also exists in a number of other proteins associated with protein synthesis, but not among enzymes of intermediary metabolism. While the universal blocks imply that modern Bacteria and Archaea (as defined by their translational machinery) clearly have had a common ancestor, the phylodomain-specific blocks imply that these two groups derive from single, phylodomain-specific types that came into existence at some point Iona after that common ancestor. The simplest explanation for this pattern would be a major evolutionary bottleneck, or other scenario that drastically limited the progenitors of modern prokaryotic diversity at a time considerably after the evolution of a fully functional translation apparatus. The vast range of habitats and metabolisms that prokaryotes occupy today would thus reflect divergent evolution after such a restricting event. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis places the origin of eukaryotes at about the same time and shows a closer relationship of the eukaryotic ribosome-associated proteins to crenarchaeal rather than euryarchaeal Counterparts.

  Abstract                 = {Heritability allows a comparison of the relative importance of genes and environment to the variation of traits within and across populations. The concept of heritability and its definition as an estimable, dimensionless population parameter was introduced by Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher nearly a century ago. Despite continuous misunderstandings and controversies over its use and application, heritability remains key to the response to selection in evolutionary biology and agriculture, and to the prediction of disease risk in medicine. Recent reports of substantial heritability for gene expression and new estimation methods using marker data highlight the relevance of heritability in the genomics era. },

Due to differences in the time and mechanisms of transmission, horizontal and vertical infections may lead to differences in the growth of the parasite within the host. This may influence parasite virulence, transmission to new hosts, and, consequently, epidemiology and evolution. Here we describe the within-host dynamics of 3 spore-types of O. bayeri from infections that were acquired either horizontally or vertically. In all treatments the number of spores increased exponentially until spore density reached a plateau, suggesting density-dependent within-host growth. The spore types seen differ in their growth dynamics, suggesting different roles in the parasite life-cycle. Horizontally-infected hosts harboured significantly fewer spores than vertically-infected hosts. Further, host survival was affected by infection route, with mortality being higher in horizontal infections than in vertical infections. Our results suggest that different routes of infection have an immediate effect on within-host parasite growth and thus on parasite fitness and epidemiology.}

With small scaled mutation rates theta(0) and theta(1), which is appropriate for single nucleotide polymorphism data in highly recombining regions, we derive a simple approximate equilibrium distribution for polymorphic alleles with a constant of proportionality. We also put forth an even simpler model, where all mutations originate from monomorphic states. Using this model we derive the sojourn times, conditional on the ancestral and fixed allele, and under equilibrium the distributions of fixed and polymorphic alleles and fixation rates. Furthermore, we also derive the distribution of small samples in the diffusion limit and provide convenient recurrence relations for calculating this distribution. This enables us to give formulas analogous to the Ewens-Watterson estimator of theta for biased mutation rates and selection. We apply this theory to a polymorphism dataset of fourfold degenerate sites in Drosophila melanogaster. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The behavioural manipulation hypothesis posits that parasites can change the behaviour of hosts to increase the reproductive fitness of the parasite. The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii fits this description well. Sexual reproduction occurs in the cat intestine, from which highly stable oocysts are excreted in faeces. Grazing animals, including rodents, can then ingest these oocysts. The parasite has evolved the capacity to abolish the innate fear that rodents have of the odours of cats, and to convert that fear into an attraction. This presumably increases the likelihood of the rodent being predated, thereby completing the parasite's life cycle. The behavioural syndrome produced by T gondii does not have any precedent in neuroscience research. This is not a case where the normal functioning of fear system have been altered. This is not even the case of the altering of fear towards predator odours, while leaving other kinds of fear intact. This is an unprecedented example of one component of the fear being eliminated (and replaced by a novel attraction), while appearing to leave other domains unchanged. An understanding of the neurobiological effects of T gondii is beginning to emerge. One possibility is T gondii's preferential localisation to, and effects within the amygdala; this is particularly intriguing, given the role of this brain structure in the normal fear response. Obviously, far more must be understood, and the unique behavioural effects of T gondii put very demanding constraints on any hypothesis we formulate to explain proximate neurobiological mechanisms. },

After a gene duplication where both genes are retained, it predicts that original and duplicate genes diverge at clock-like rates. This prediction is usually tested for coding sequences, but can also be applied to another important aspect of gene function, the genes' expression pattern. Moreover. if both sequence and expression pattern diverge at clock-like rates, a correlation between divergence in sequence and divergence in expression patterns is expected. Duplicate gene pairs with more highly diverged sequences should also show more highly diverged expression patterns. This prediction is tested for a large sample of duplicated genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using both genome sequence and microarray expression data. Only a weak correlation is observed, suggesting that coding sequence and {mRNA} expression patterns of duplicate gene pairs evolve independently and at vastly different rates. Implications of this finding for the neutralist-selectionist debate are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {"A continuum of alleles model with pair-wise A x A epistasis is proposed and its transmission genetic, and variational properties are analysed. The basic idea is that genes control the values of underlying variables, which affect the genotypic value of phenotypic characters proportional to a "scaling factor". Epistasis is the influence of one gene on the average effect of another gene. In this model, epistasis is introduced as a mutational effect of one gene on the scaling factors of another gene. In accordance with empirical results, the model assumes that the average direct effect of mutations is zero, as is the average epistatic effect. The model predicts that, on average, a mutation at one locus increases the expected mutational variance of mutations at another interacting locus. The increase in mutational variance is predicted to be equal to the variance of the pair-wise epistatic effects. This result is consistent with the observation that mutant phenotypes tend to be more variable than the wildtype phenotype. Another generic result of this model is that the frequency of canalizing mutations can at most be equal to the frequency of decanalizing mutations. Furthermore, it is predicted that the mutational variance of a character increases at least linearly with the size of the character; hence this model is scale variant. In the case of two characters it is shown that the dimensionality of the locus-specific mutational effect distribution is invariant, i.e. the rank of the mutational covariance matrix M is invariant. While in additive models the mutational covariance matrix is always and entirely invariant, the invariance in the case of epistatic models is unexpected. Epistatic interactions can change the magnitude of the mutational (co)variances at a locus and can thus influence the structure of the mutational covariance matrix. However, in the present model the dimensionality of the mutational effect distribution remains the same. A consequence of this result is that, in this model, the genetic architecture of a set of characters is always evolvable i.e. no hard constraints can evolve"}

"Therefore the llevels of infection within individulals are determined primarily by the capacity of hte host to control this replication." 1. Malaria: First level of immunity related to polymorphs related to target red-cells that affect parasite's ability to invade or develop. MHC appears to have little influence b/c in general there is substantial var. b/w parasites and lots of potential epitopes. Antibody titer and Tcell mediated responses may be important 2. Leishmania: Infects macrophages, apparently. Lots of variation in responses to parasite which lead to variation in disease responses. MHC and background genes are involved. Susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis has been linked to a single gene Lsh (in mouse?) and appears to also control suscept. to natural mouse parasitic spp. of Samonella and Mycobacterium. Lsh is related to macrophage's suitability for intracellular pathogens. Other genes have also been identified for controlling infection of other Leishmania spp. 3. Intestinal Protozoa: "Among the most common of all infections\ldots" Genetic variation in mice has been detected for suscp. to a number of different spp. including Giardia and Eimeria. Variation for Giardia related to ability to fully clear infection or if it lingers. May be related to IgA deficiency. B. Helminths: larger than most protozoan parasite targets, therefore, require other aspects of IR to clear. Also have protective surface layer and may be located in different parts of organism which "\ldots may circumscribe the mech. that are otherewise able to exert deleterious effects" of the IR on the parasite. 1. Schistosomes: Lots of variation in load b/w hosts w/ equal levels of exposure. IgE responses seem to be important in reisstnace. Apparently this may be the result of a "well est." trade-off b/w IgE and IgG$_4$ production which is determined by " the balance of active T cell subsets and their assoc. cytokine profiles. One possibility is, therefore, that suscp. individuals are progreammed to prodeuce the 'wrong' antibody responses can, in fact, block protective immune mech. and maintain chronic infection in the host." 2. Tapeworms: Variation in mice to est. of larval Taenia teniaeformis is " now known to be expressed through background genes that regulate the speed at whidch antiparasite antibody is produced. In rapid responders complement-fixing antibodies become avalilable before the larval worms develop an effective anticomplementary activity." Talks about a study of a natural pop. of deer mice and adult tapeworms. Distn. across hosts was highly aggregated and apparently due to a single gene which was due to a single dominant resist allele. Mech behind resistance is unknown. Research group headed by Wassom (70s and 80s) 3. Gastrointestinal nematodes: "among the most common [infections] experience by humans and [domesticated?] animal hosts." Agg. infect. in hosts could be due to gen. var. observed in lab. Several spp. "reach intestine afeter pereneral migrations (e.g. Ascaris, hookworms, \ldots) antiworm [antibody] responses can act against theses migrating stages, particularly during reinfections." Lots of different aspects of IR can become involved. Ab "may play an import. role against a number of gastro. nematodes. The binidng o fthe antibody to target molec. present ont the cuticle and intest. epithelium... can interfere with a variety of essent. activites. includ. behavior., mutrit. reprod. and defense mech." Impt. ab include: IgG, IgA, and IgE in fact, GI "nematodes elicit strong IgE responses, and this isotype has long been implicated in protect. immunity through its involvement in immediate hypersensitivity reactions\ldots" Both MHC and background genes are important. 4. Filarial nematodes: Apperently family of nematodes that are transmitted via arthropod vectors. Lots of var. in humans to suscept. "Infective larvae seem to be import. targests of IR leading to resist., whereas responses directed against adult and microfilarial stages may lead to pathology." C. Arthropods: V. Conclusion: "The realization that relatively few genes exert bilogocially significant effects on host resistance makes it possible to see that evolutionary change in the balance of a relationship can occur as a result of small alterations in parasite or host activity." It seems that for each case of resistance or suscept. only a few genes are involved. These are the key potential weak links in the system and my guess is that which links are the weak ones may shift over time as the host-evolves and counter evolves or, if there is constrain on the host, would be static reaching a stable polymorphism. Now there's a good question. If the key genes shift then it would appear that the red queen hypoth. could apply for maint. of sex and other things, but if they don't, then it doesn't apply. Are there empirical systems in which this could be tested? Bacterial-phage would be ideal, in some sense, but they may lack the required complexity? It seems like to get links to shift noticably you need a long chain (i.e. a complex IR response), but if this were true, then that means r.q. would apply more to org. with complex IR (which are assumedly longer living org.). Imagine two scenarios: one where the suscept/resist of the h-p interaction is always centered at one place (e.g. initial Ab recog) such as influenza virus variation b/w years vs. a system where the determinant of s/r changes over time. One would be driven by var. in parasite, perhaps, the other, var. in host that the parasite then evolves to exploit. . }

  Abstract                 = {Synonymous mutations are considered to be "silent" as they do not affect protein sequence. However, different silent codons have different translation efficiency (TE), which raises the question to what extent such mutations are really neutral. We perform the first genome-wide study of natural selection operating on TE in recent human evolution, surveying 13,798 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,198 unrelated individuals from 11 populations. We find evidence for both negative and positive selection on TE, as measured based on differentiation in allele frequencies between populations. Notably, the likelihood of an SNP to be targeted by positive or negative selection is correlated with the magnitude of its effect on the TE of the corresponding protein. Furthermore, negative selection acting against changes in TE is more marked in highly expressed genes, highly interacting proteins, complex members, and regulatory genes. It is also more common in functional regions and in the initial segments of highly expressed genes. Positive selection targeting sites with a large effect on TE is stronger in lowly interacting proteins and in regulatory genes. Similarly, essential genes are enriched for negative TE selection while underrepresented for positive TE selection. Taken together, these results point to the significant role of TE as a selective force operating in humans and hence underscore the importance of considering silent SNPs in interpreting associations with complex human diseases. Testifying to this potential, we describe two synonymous SNPs that may have clinical implications in phenylketonuria and in Best's macular dystrophy due to TE differences between alleles.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary Huntington's disease is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a distinct phenotype, including chorea and dystonia, incoordination, cognitive decline, and behavioural difficulties. Typically, onset of symptoms is in middle-age after affected individuals have had children, but the disorder can manifest at any time between infancy and senescence. The mutant protein in Huntington's disease--huntingtin--results from an expanded CAG repeat leading to a polyglutamine strand of variable length at the N-terminus. Evidence suggests that this tail confers a toxic gain of function. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of Huntington's disease are poorly understood, but research in transgenic animal models of the disorder is providing insight into causative factors and potential treatments.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolutionary rates of proteins vary over several orders of magnitude. Recent work suggests that analysis of large data sets of evolutionary rates in conjunction with the results from high-throughput functional genomic experiments can identify the factors that cause proteins to evolve at such dramatically different rates. To this end, we estimated the evolutionary rates of >3,000 proteins in four species of the yeast genus Saccharomyces and investigated their relationship with levels of expression and protein dispensability. Each protein's dispensability was estimated by the growth rate of mutants deficient for the protein. Our analyses of these improved evolutionary and functional genomic data sets yield three main results. First, dispensability and expression have independent, significant effects on the rate of protein evolution. Second, measurements of expression levels in the laboratory can be used to filter data sets of dispensability estimates, removing variates that are unlikely to reflect real biological effects. Third, structural equation models show that although we may reasonably infer that dispensability and expression have significant effects on protein evolutionary rate, we cannot yet accurately estimate the relative strengths of these effects.},

When infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), perforin-less (-/-) mice showed clear signs of having mounted an immune response based on activation of CD8 T cells but were unable to dear the LCMV infection. This failure to eliminate virus was accompanied by a failure to generate spleen cells capable of lysing LCMV-infected fibroblasts \emph{in vitro}. Spleen cells from LCMV-infected -/- mice were able to lyse hematopoietic target cells after exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, provided the target cells expressed the Fas antigen. Spleen cells from -/- mice also responded to alloantigen in mixed leukocyte culture by blastogenesis and proliferation. The resulting cells were able to lyse hematopoietic target cells, although not as well as spleen cells from +/+ littermates sensitized in the same manner. However, lysis by -/- cells was again seen only if the target cells expressed Fas antigen. We conclude that perforin-less -/- mice retain and express the Fas lytic pathway as expressed \emph{in vitro} but that this pathway is insufficient to clear an LCMV infection \emph{in vivo}.},

Adaptive strategies of microbes with different niches are genomically encoded: Specialists have smaller genomes than generalists, and microbes with environmental reservoirs have large accessory genomes. A shift toward a Neolithic diet increased loads of simple carbohydrates and selected for their increased breakdown and absorption in the small intestine. Humans who outcompeted microbes for the new substrates obtained more energy from their diets and prospered, an evolutionary process reflected in modern population genetics.

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have provided evolutionary explanations for much of the variation in mortality among human infectious diseases. One gap in this knowledge concerns respiratory tract pathogens transmitted from person to person by direct contact or through environmental contamination. The sit-and-wait hypothesis predicts that virulence should be positively correlated with durability in the external environment because high durability reduces the dependence of transmission on host mobility. Reviewing the epidemiological and medical literature, we confirm this prediction for respiratory tract pathogens of humans. Our results clearly distinguish a high-virulence high-survival group of variola (smallpox) virus, Mycobacterium. tuberculosis, Corynebacterium diphitheriae, Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and influenza virus (where all pathogens have a mean percent mortality greater than or equal to 0.01\% and mean survival time > 10 days) from a low-virulence low-survival group containing ten other pathogens. The correlation between virulence and durability explains three to four times of magnitude of difference in mean percent mortality and mean survival time, using both across-species and phylogenetically controlled analyses. Our findings bear on several areas of active research and public health policy: (1) many pathogens used in the biological control of insects are potential sit-and-wait pathogens as they combine three attributes that are advantageous for pest control: high virulence, long durability after application, and host specificity; (2) emerging pathogens such as the 'hospital superbug' methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and potential bio-weapons pathogens such as smallpox virus and anthrax that are particularly dangerous can be discerned by quantifying their durability; (3) hospital settings and the AIDS pandemic may provide footholds for emerging sit-and-wait pathogens; and (4) studies on food-borne and insect pathogens point to future research considering the potential evolutionary trade-offs and genetic linkages between virulence and durability.},

Previous research showed the codon usage bias was associated with many biological processes, such as protein expression level, genetic coding error minimization, {mRNA} stability. codon context, {tRNA} richness, CpG suppression, DNA methylation, and tissue or organ specificity. In this paper were viewed major methods of codon usage bias measurement. Since most of existing methods are only suitable for the comparison of codon usage bias within a single genome, we introduced a new informatics index, referred to as synonymous codon usage order (SCUO), to measure synonymous codon usage bias within and across genomes. In this method, Shannon informational theory was applied to describe the SCUO of each gene using a value ranging from 0 to 1, with larger values associated with greater codon usage bias. We compared our method with the codon adaptation index (CAI) method for measuring codon bias in Escherichia coli and Sacharomyces cerevisiae. We also studied the correlation between SCUO and CAI, and the relation of SCUO with gene length, gene function. and GC composition. In addition, we explored the correlation between SCUO and m RNA abundance in S. cerevisiae using SAGE expression data.

  Abstract                 = {Standard protein phylogenetic models use fixed rate matrices of amino acid interchange derived from analyses of large databases. Differences between the stationary amino acid frequencies of these rate matrices from those of a data set of interest are typically adjusted for by matrix multiplication that converts the empirical rate matrix to an exchangeability matrix which is then postmultiplied by the amino acid frequencies in the alignment. The result is a time-reversible rate matrix with stationary amino acid frequencies equal to the data set frequencies. On the basis of population genetics principles, we develop an amino acid substitution-selection model that parameterizes the fitness of an amino acid as the logarithm of the ratio of the frequency of the amino acid to the frequency of the same amino acid under no selection. The model gives rise to a different sequence of matrix multiplications to convert an empirical rate matrix to one that has stationary amino acid frequencies equal to the data set frequencies. We incorporated the substitution-selection model with an improved amino acid class frequency mixture (cF) model to partially take into account site-specific amino acid frequencies in the phylogenetic models. We show that 1) the selection models fit data significantly better than corresponding models without selection for most of the 21 test data sets; 2) both cF and cF selection models favored the phylogenetic trees that were inferred under current sophisticated models and methods for three difficult phylogenetic problems (the positions of microsporidia and breviates in eukaryote phylogeny and the position of the root of the angiosperm tree); and 3) for data simulated under site-specific residue frequencies, the cF selection models estimated trees closer to the generating trees than a standard Г model or cF without selection. We also explored several ways of estimating amino acid frequencies under neutral evolution that are required for these selection models. By better modeling the amino acid substitution process, the cF selection models will be valuable for phylogenetic inference and evolutionary studies.},

The principle of SAGE has been developed to address specific issues such as determination of normal gene structure and identification of abnormal genome structural changes. This review focuses on the general features of SAGE data, including the specificity of SAGE tags with respect to their original transcripts, the quantitative nature of SAGE data for differentially expressed genes, the reproducibility, the comparability of SAGE with microarray and the future potential of SAGE. Understanding these basic features should aid the proper interpretation of SAGE data to address biological and medical questions.},

It was validated against results from field trials where worm populations and rate of growth of cattle treated with anthelmintics were compared to similar groups of untreated animals. A close correlation between observed and predicted values for faecal egg and pasture larval counts was seen in the cattle which had been treated with an oxfendazole pulse release bolus at turnout. Timings and peak values were less accurately predicted in the untreated cattle. Although predictions for live weight gain during the grazing season indicated that the model may be overestimating the potential growth rate of cattle, it is considered that the model provides a suitable tool for comparing the effectiveness of different worming programmes under farm conditions. The computer simulation also allowed examination of the underlying influences and interactions between parasitological factors, such as numbers of immature and adult worms, and animal and pasture factors, such as sward height, grass consumption and feed conversion, in the parasite's influence on animal performance.

  Abstract                 = {Coding sequence evolution was once thought to be the result of selection on optimal protein function alone. Selection can, however, also act at the RNA level, for example, to facilitate rapid translation or ensure correct splicing. Here, we ask whether the way DNA works also imposes constraints on coding sequence evolution. We identify nucleosome positioning as a likely candidate to set up such a DNA-level selective regime and use high-resolution microarray data in yeast to compare the evolution of coding sequence bound to or free from nucleosomes. Controlling for gene expression and intra-gene location, we find a nucleosome-free "clinker" sequence to evolve on average 5-6\% slower at synonymous sites. A reduced rate of evolution in linker is especially evident at the 5' end of genes, where the effect extends to non-synonymous substitution rates. This is consistent with regular nucleosome architecture in this region being important in the context of gene expression control. As predicted, codons likely to generate a sequence unfavourable to nucleosome formation are enriched in linker sequence. Amino acid content is likewise skewed as a function of nucleosome occupancy. We conclude that selection operating on DNA to maintain correct positioning of nucleosomes impacts codon choice, amino acid choice, and synonymous and non-synonymous rates of evolution in coding sequence. The results support the exclusion model for nucleosome positioning and provide an alternative interpretation for runs of rare codons. As the intimate association of histones and DNA is a universal characteristic of genic sequence in eukaryotes, selection on coding sequence composition imposed by nucleosome positioning should be phylogenetically widespread.},

  Abstract                 = {In Drosophila melanogaster, synonymous codons corresponding to the most abundant cognate {tRNA}s are used more frequently, especially in highly expressed genes. Increased use of such "optimal" codons is considered an adaptation for translational efficiency. Need it always be the case that selection should favor the use of a translationally optimal codon? Here, we investigate one possible confounding factor, namely, the need to specify information in exons necessary to enable correct splicing. As expected from such a model, in Drosophila many codons show different usage near intron-exon boundaries versus exon core regions. However, this finding is in principle also consistent with Hill-Robertson effects modulating usage of translationally optimal codons. However, several results support the splice model over the translational selection model: 1) the trends in codon usage are strikingly similar to those in mammals in which codon usage near boundaries correlates with abundance in exonic splice enhancers (ESEs), 2) codons preferred near boundaries tend to be enriched for A and avoid C (conversely those avoided near boundaries prefer C rather than A), as expected were ESEs involved, and 3) codons preferred near boundaries are typically not translationally optimal. We conclude that usage of translationally optimal codons usage is compromised in the vicinity of splice junctions in intron-containing genes, to the effect that we observe higher levels of usage of translationally optimal codons at the center of exons. On the gene level, however, controlling for known correlates of codon bias, the impact on codon usage patterns is quantitatively small. These results have implications for inferring aspects of the mechanism of splicing given nothing more than a well-annotated genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Despite a strong evolutionary pressure to reduce genome size, proteins vary in length over a surprisingly wide range also in very compact genomes. Here we investigated the evolutionary forces that act on protein size in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizing a system-wide bioinformatics approach. Data on yeast protein size was compared to global experimental data on protein expression, phenotypic pleiotropy, protein-protein interactions, protein evolutionary rate and biochemical classification. Results: Comparing the experimentally determined abundance of individual proteins, highly expressed proteins were found to be consistently smaller than lowly expressed proteins, in accordance with the biosynthetic cost minimization hypothesis. Yeast proteins able to maintain a high expression level despite a large size tended to belong to a very distinct set of protein families, notably nuclear transport and translation initiation/elongation. Large proteins have significantly more protein-protein interactions than small proteins, suggesting that a requirement for multiple interaction domains may constitute a positive selective pressure for large protein size in yeast. The higher frequency of proteinprotein interactions in large proteins was not accompanied by a higher phenotypic pleiotropy. Hence, the increase in interactions may not reflect an increase in function differentiation. Proteins of different sizes also evolved at similar rates. Finally, whereas the biological process involved was found to have little influence on protein size the biochemical activity exerted by the protein represented a dominant factor. More than one third of all biochemical activity classes were enriched in one or more size intervals. Conclusion: In yeast, there is an inverse relationship between protein size and protein expression such that highly expressed proteins tend to be of smaller size. Also, protein size is moderately affected by protein connectivity and strongly affected by biochemical activity. Phenotypic pleiotropy does not seem to affect protein size.},

Categorization of these hits demonstrated the ability of this technology to detect and identify proteins rarely seen in proteome analysis, including low-abundance proteins like transcription factors and protein kinases. Furthermore, we identified 131 proteins with three or more predicted transmembrane domains, which allowed us to map the soluble domains of many of the integral membrane proteins.

Our results support proposals that both the beginning of coding regions and codons matching rare tRNAs are more slowly translated. They also indicate that emergent polypeptides with as few as three basic residues within a ten-residue window tend to slow translation. With the improved mRNA measurements, the variation attributable to translational control in exponentially growing yeast was less than previously reported, and most of this variation could be predicted with a simple model that considered mRNA abundance, upstream open reading frames, cap-proximal structure and nucleotide composition, and lengths of the coding and 50 UTRs. Collectively, our results provide a framework for executing and interpreting ribosome-profiling studies and reveal key features of translational control in yeast.},

Recently, the view of aging as an extremely complex multifactorial process has replaced the earlier search for a distinct cause such as a single gene or the decline of a key body system. This minireview keeps in mind the multiplicity of mechanisms regulating aging; examines them at the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels; and explores the possibility of interactions at these three levels. The heterogeneity of the aging phenotype among individuals of the same species and differences in longevity among species underline the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors in shaping the life span. Thus, the presence of several trajectories of the life span, from incidence of disease and disability to absence of pathology and persistence of function, suggest that it is possible to experimentally ( e. g., by calorie restriction) prolong functional plasticity and life span. In this minireview, several theories are identified only briefly; a few ( evolutionary, gene regulation, cellular senescence, free radical, and neuro-endocrineimmuno theories) are discussed in more detail, at molecular, cellular, and systemic levels. },

These studies were based on the serologically-defined five-locus HLA-A, -C, -B, -DR, -DQ haplotype, To further elucidate the effects of specific major histocompatibility (MHC) loci or regions on fetal loss and mate choice, we genotyped a sample of Hutterites for 14 MHC loci by DNA or biochemical methods. Typing for additional loci in the HLA-A to HLA-DPB1 region increased the number of recognized Hutterite MHC haplotypes to 67, and further localized the site of crossover in 9 of 15 recombinant haplotypes. Hutterite MHC haplotype sequences are similar to those observed in outbred Caucasians, suggesting that the influence of HLA haplotypes on fetal loss and mating structure may be general. }

These sequences are not all equally useful however; the exact sequence chosen can have profound effects on the expression of the encoded protein. Despite the importance of protein-coding sequences, there has been little systematic study to identify parameters that affect expression. This is probably because protein expression has largely been tackled on an ad hoc basis in many independent projects: once a sequence has been obtained that yields adequate expression for that project, there is little incentive to continue work on the problem. Synthetic biology may now provide the impetus to transform protein expression folklore into design principles, so that DNA sequences may easily be designed to express any protein in any system. In this review, we offer a brief survey of the literature, outline the major challenges in interpreting existing data and constructing robust design algorithms, and propose a way to proceed towards the goal of rational sequence engineering.},

The distribution of pause lengths, with a median of 2.8 s, indicates that at least two rate-determining processes control each pause. Each translocation step measures three bases--one codon-and occurs in less than 0.1 s. Analysis of the times required for translocation reveals, surprisingly, that there are three substeps in each step. Pause lengths, and thus the overall rate of translation, depend on the secondary structure of the {mRNA}; the applied force destabilizes secondary structure and decreases pause durations, but does not affect translocation times. Translocation and {RNA} unwinding are strictly coupled ribosomal functions.},

  Abstract                 = {In social groups composed of kin, inclusive fitness benefits can favor greater cooperation. Alternatively, cooperation can be enforced through the policing of less cooperative individuals. Here, we show that the effect of policing can be twofold: not only can it directly suppress individual selfishness, it can also entirely remove the incentive for individuals to act selfishly in the first place. We term such individual restraint in response to socially imposed policing "acquiescence" and illustrate the concept using examples drawn from the social Hymenoptera ( the ants, bees, and wasps). Inclusive fitness models confirm that when a policing system is in place, individuals should be less tempted to act selfishly. This is shown to have important consequences for the resolution of conflict within their societies. For example, it can explain why in many species very few workers attempt to reproduce and why immature females usually do not attempt to develop as queens rather than workers. Although our analyses are primarily focused on the social insects, our conclusions are likely to be general and to apply to other societies as well.},

Fitness itself can change, however, and the amount of change in the parameters of the fitness functions required to allow deterministic evolution to new adaptive peaks is very small. The probability of environmental changes sufficient to allow substantial morphological evolution or reproductive isolation is large relative to the probability that similar changes could occur by processes requiring genetic drift, even with very small population sizes. The rapid evolution or speciation following a population founding event is more closely linked with environmental changes than genetic drift.},

  Abstract                 = {Mechanisms underlying the dramatic patterns of genome size variation across the tree of life remain mysterious. Effective population size (Ne) has been proposed as a major driver of genome size: selection is expected to efficiently weed out deleterious mutations increasing genome size in lineages with large (but not small) Ne. Strong support for this model was claimed from a comparative analysis of Neu and genome size for approximate to 30 phylogenetically diverse species ranging from bacteria to vertebrates, but analyses at that scale have so far failed to account for phylogenetic nonindependence of species. In our reanalysis, accounting for phylogenetic history substantially altered the perceived strength of the relationship between Neu and genomic attributes: there were no statistically significant associations between Neu and gene number, intron size, intron number, the half-life of gene duplicates, transposon number, transposons as a fraction of the genome, or overall genome size. We conclude that current datasets do not support the hypothesis of a mechanistic connection between Ne and these genomic attributes, and we suggest that further progress requires larger datasets, phylogenetic comparative methods, more robust estimators of genetic drift, and a multivariate approach that accounts for correlations between putative explanatory variables.},

Posing this as a control problem, we investigate whether it is best to apply control to the main focus, the outlier populations, or some combination of these. We first formulate and solve a discrete-time optimal control problem to determine where control is best applied over a finite time horizon. However, if limited funds are available for control, this optimal solution may not be feasible. In this case, we add an additional constraint to account for the fixed budget and solve the new optimality system.

  Abstract                 = {tRNA biogenesis in yeast involves the synthesis of the initial transcript by RNA polymerase III followed by processing and controlled degradation in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. A vast landscape of regulatory elements controlling tRNA stability in yeast has emerged from recent studies. Diverse pathways of tRNA maturation generate multiple stable and unstable intermediates. A significant impact on tRNA stability is exerted by a variety of nucleotide modifications. Pre-tRNAs are targets of exosome-dependent surveillance in the nucleus. Some tRNAs that are hypomodified or bear specific destabilizing mutations are directed to the rapid tRNA decay pathway leading to 53 exonucleolytic degradation by Rat1 and Xrn1. tRNA molecules are selectively marked for degradation by a double CCA at their 3 ends. In addition, under different stress conditions, tRNA half-molecules can be generated by independent endonucleolytic cleavage events. Recent studies reveal unexpected relationships between the subsequent steps of tRNA biosynthesis and the mechanisms controlling its quality and turnover.

Yet recent evidence indicates that the evolution of these genes is strongly shaped by the biophysical processes of protein synthesis, protein folding, and specific as well as nonspecific protein-protein interactions. Selection pressures related to these biophysical processes affect primarily the amino-acid sequence of genes, but they also leave their mark on synonymous sites at the nucleotide level. While evidence for specific selection pressures related to protein biophysics is strong, there is currently no unifying framework that integrates the various selection pressures on coding sequences and disentangles their relative importance.},

  Abstract                 = {Phenotypic mutations are errors that occur during protein synthesis. These errors lead to amino acid substitutions that give rise to abnormal proteins. Experiments suggest that such errors are quite common. We present a model to study the effect of phenotypic mutation rates on the amount of abnormal proteins in a cell. In our model, genes are regulated to synthesize a certain number of functional proteins. During this process, depending on the phenotypic mutation rate, abnormal proteins are generated. We use data on protein length and abundance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to parametrize our model. We calculate that for small phenotypic mutation rates most abnormal proteins originate from highly expressed genes that are on average nearly twice as large as the average yeast protein. For phenotypic mutation rates much above 5 X 10(-4), the error-free synthesis of large proteins is nearly impossible and lowly expressed, very large proteins contribute more and more to the amount of abnormal proteins in a cell. This fact leads to a steep increase of the amount of abnormal proteins for phenotypic mutation rates above 5 X 10(-4). Simulations show that this property leads to an upper limit for the phenotypic mutation rate of approximately 2 X 10(-3) even if the costs for abnormal proteins are extremely low. We also consider the adaptation of individual proteins. Individual genes/proteins can decrease their phenotypic mutation rate by using preferred codons or by increasing their robustness against amino acid substitutions. We discuss the similarities and differences between the two mechanisms and show that they can only slow down but not prevent the rapid increase of the amount of abnormal proteins. Our work allows us to estimate the phenotypic mutation rate based on data on the fraction of abnormal proteins. For S. cerevisiae, we predict that the value for the phenotypic mutation rate is between 2 X 10(-4) and 6 X 10(-4). },

  Abstract                 = {The root of a phylogenetic tree is fundamental to its biological interpretation, but standard substitution models do not provide any information on its position. Here, we describe two recently developed models that relax the usual assumptions of stationarity and reversibility, thereby facilitating root inference without the need for an outgroup. We compare the performance of these models on a classic test case for phylogenetic methods, before considering two highly topical questions in evolutionary biology: the deep structure of the tree of life and the root of the archaeal radiation. We show that all three alignments contain meaningful rooting information that can be harnessed by these new models, thus complementing and extending previous work based on outgroup rooting. In particular, our analyses exclude the root of the tree of life from the eukaryotes or Archaea, placing it on the bacterial stem or within the Bacteria. They also exclude the root of the archaeal radiation from several major clades, consistent with analyses using other rooting methods. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of non-reversible and non-stationary models for rooting phylogenetic trees, and identify areas where further progress can be made.},

  Abstract                 = {Severe inbreeding depression is routinely observed in outcrossing species. If inbreeding load is due largely to deleterious alleles of large effect, such as recessive lethals or steriles, then most of it is expected to be purged during brief periods of inbreeding. In contrast, if inbreeding depression is due to the cumulative effects of many deleterious alleles of small effect, then it will be maintained in the face of periodic inbreeding. Whether or not inbreeding depression can be purged with inbreeding in the short term has important implications for the evolution of mating systems and the probability that a small population will go extinct. In this paper I evaluate the extent to which the tremendous inbreeding load in a primarily outcrossing population of the wildflower, Mimulus guttatus, is due to alleles of large effect. To do this, I first constructed a large outbred "ancestral" population by randomly mating plants collected as seeds from a natural population. From this population I formed 1200 lines that were maintained by self-fertilization and single seedling descent: after five generations of selfing, 335 lines had survived the inbreeding process. Selection during the line formation is expected to have largely purged alleles of large effect from the collection of highly inbred lines. Because alleles with minor effects on fitness should have been effectively neutral, the inbreeding depression due to this class of genes should have been unchanged. The inbred lines were intercrossed to form a large, outcrossed "purged" population. Finally, I estimated the fitness of outbred and selfed progeny from the ancestral and purged populations to determine the contribution of major deleterious alleles on inbreeding depression. I found that although the average fitness of the outcrossed progeny nearly doubled following purging, the limited decline in inbreeding depression and limited increase in inbred fitness indicates that alleles of large effect are not the principle cause of inbreeding depression in this population. In aggregate, the data suggest that lethals and steriles make a minority contribution to inbreeding depression and that the increased outbred fitness is due primarily to adaptation to greenhouse conditions.},

We introduce a novel method for the analysis of variation in selection pressures within and between species, spatially along the genome and temporally between lineages. We model codon evolution explicitly using a joint population genetics-phylogenetics approach that we developed for the construction of multiallelic models with mutation, selection, and drift. Our approach has the advantage of performing direct inference on coding sequences, inferring ancestral states probabilistically, utilizing allele frequency information, and generalizing to multiple species. We use a Bayesian sliding window model for intragenic variation in selection coefficients that efficiently combines information across sites and captures spatial clustering within the genome. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we infer selective pressures acting in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans from polymorphism and divergence data for 100 X-linked coding regions.},

  Abstract                 = {The treatment of viral infections using antiviral drugs has had a significant public health benefit in the setting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and newly developed drugs offer potential benefits in the management of other viral infections, including acute self-limiting infections such as influenza and picornaviruses (including the rhinoviruses that are responsible for a large proportion of 'common colds'). A serious concern with such treatments is that they may lead to the selection of drug-resistant strains. This has been a significant problem in the case of HIV infection. Existing mathematical-modelling studies of drug resistance have focused on the interactions between virus, target cells and infected cells, ignoring the impact of immune responses. Here, we present a model that explores the role of immune responses in the rise of drug-resistant mutants \emph{in vivo}. We find that drug resistance is unlikely to be a problem if immune responses are maintained above a threshold level during therapy. Alternatively, if immune responses decline at a fast rate and fall below a threshold level during treatment (indicating impaired immunity), the rise of drug-resistant mutants is more likely. This indicates an important difference between HIV, which impairs immunity and for which immune responses have been observed to vanish during treatment, and viral infections such as influenza and rhinoviruses, for which such immune impairment is not present. Drug resistance is much more likely to be a problem in HIV than in acute and self-limiting infections. },

Experiments suggest that HIV can only replicate in activated T cells whereas cell activation may not be required for successful replication in macrophages. These assumptions lead to fundamentally different conditions required to establish a persistent infection in the two cell types. While persistent replication in macrophages is achieved if the basic reproductive ratio of the virus, R-0, exceeds unity, the establishment of T cell infection may depend on a complex balance between host and viral parameters as well as initial conditions. More specifically, the replication rate of HIV needs to lie above a threshold level and the immune responsiveness of the host below a certain threshold for persistent T cell infection to be possible. In addition, initial virus load has to be intermediate and the initial abundance of CTLs low. Mathematical models predict that macrophage infection may be essential for the successful establishment of HIV in the primary phase of the infection. Acting as a reservoir, they allow the virus to evolve towards increased replication kinetics as well as away from immune recognition, thus paving the way for the rise of exclusively T cell tropic strains using the CXCR4-coreceptor.

Understanding the factors that are responsible for the characteristic rate of evolution of a given protein arguably is one of the major goals of evolutionary biology. A long-standing general assumption used to be that the evolution rate is, primarily, determined by the specific functional constraints that affect the given protein. These constrains were traditionally thought to depend both on the specific features of the protein's structure and its biological role. The advent of systems biology brought about new types of data, such as expression level and protein-protein interactions, and unexpectedly, a variety of correlations between protein evolution rate and these variables have been observed. The strongest connections by far were repeatedly seen between protein sequence evolution rate and the expression level of the respective gene. It has been hypothesized that this link is due to the selection for the robustness of the protein structure to mistranslation-induced misfolding that is particularly important for highly expressed proteins and is the dominant determinant of the sequence evolution rate. Results: This work is an attempt to assess the relative contributions of protein domain structure and function, on the one hand, and expression level on the other hand, to the rate of sequence evolution. To this end, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the effect of the fusion of a pair of domains in multidomain proteins on the difference in the domain-specific evolutionary rates. The mistranslation-induced misfolding hypothesis would predict that, within multidomain proteins, fused domains, on average, should evolve at substantially closer rates than the same domains in different proteins because, within a mutlidomain protein, all domains are translated at the same rate. We performed a comprehensive comparison of the evolutionary rates of mammalian and plant protein domains that are either joined in multidomain proteins or contained in distinct proteins. Substantial homogenization of evolutionary rates in multidomain proteins was, indeed, observed in both animals and plants, although highly significant differences between domain-specific rates remained. The contributions of the translation rate, as determined by the effect of the fusion of a pair of domains within a multidomain protein, and intrinsic, domain-specific structural-functional constraints appear to be comparable in magnitude. Conclusion: Fusion of domains in a multidomain protein results in substantial homogenization of the domain-specific evolutionary rates but significant differences between domain-specific evolution rates remain. Thus, the rate of translation and intrinsic structural-functional constraints both exert sizable and comparable effects on sequence evolution.

The greatest mystery is the molecular basis of diploidization, the evolutionary, process by which a polyploid genome turns into a diploid one. },

Now it is difficult to find sequences with only a few homologs to use as examples for teaching bioinformatics. For molecular evolution researchers, the genomics revolution has showered us with raw data and the information revolution has given us the wherewithal to analyze it. In broad terms, the most significant outcome from these changes has been our newfound ability to examine the evolution of genomes as a whole, enabling us to infer genome-wide evolutionary patterns and to identify subsets of genes whose evolution has been in some way atypical. },

  Abstract                 = {As a paradigm of mammalian gene evolution, the nature and extent of DNA sequence divergence between homologous protein-coding genes from mouse and rat have been investigated. The data set examined includes 363 genes totalling 411 kilobases, making this by far the largest comparison conducted between a single pair of species. Mouse and rat genes are on average 93.4\% identical in nucleotide sequence and 93.9\% identical in amino acid sequence. Individual genes vary substantially in the extent of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution, as expected from protein evolution studies; here the variation is characterized. The extent of synonymous (or silent) substitution also varies considerably among genes, though the coefficient of variation is about four times smaller than for nonsynonymous substitutions. A small number of genes mapped to the X-chromosome have a slower rate of molecular evolution than average, as predicted if molecular evolution is "male-driven." Base composition at silent sites varies from 33\% to 95\% G+C in different genes; mouse and rat homologues differ on average by only 1.7\% in silent-site G+C, but it is shown that this is not necessarily due to any selective constraint on their base composition. Synonymous substitution rates and silent site base composition appear to be related (genes at intermediate G+C have on average higher rates), but the relationship is not as strong as in our earlier analyses. Rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution are correlated, apparently because of an excess of substitutions involving adjacent pairs of nucleotides. Several factors suggest that synonymous codon usage in rodent genes is not subject to selection.},

In this study, however, we have quantified the frequency of parallel and divergent genetic changes in 12 initially identical populations of Escherichia coli that evolved in identical environments for 20,000 cell generations. Unlike previous analyses in which candidate genes were identified based on parallel phenotypic changes, here we sequenced four loci (pykF, nadR, pbpA-rodA, and hokB/sokB) in which mutations of unknown effect had been discovered in one population, and then we compared the substitution pattern in these "blind" candidate genes with the pattern found in 36 randomly chosen genes. Two candidate genes, pykF and nadR, had substitutions in all 11 other populations, and the other 2 in several populations. There were very few cases, however, in which the exact same mutations were substituted, in contrast to the findings from conceptually related work performed with evolving virus populations. No random genes had any substitutions except in four populations that evolved defects in DNA repair. Tests of four different statistical aspects of the pattern of molecular evolution all indicate that adaptation by natural selection drove the parallel changes in these candidate genes.},

This review summarizes recent advances in the search for factors governing the intranodal migration behavior of naive T lymphocytes, focusing in particular on the role of extracellular pro-migratory cues, intracellular signaling components, and the influence of the structural LN environment on intranodal T-cell motility. },

  Abstract                 = {Naive T lymphocytes continuously recirculate through secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes until they are eventually activated by recognizing cognate peptide/MHC-complexes on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The intranodal T cell migration behavior leading to these crucial - and potentially rare - encounters during the induction of an adaptive immune response could not be directly addressed until, in 2002, the use of two-photon microscopy also allowed the visualization of cellular dynamics deep within intact lymph nodes. Since then, numerous studies have confirmed that, by default, naive T cells are extremely motile, scanning the paracortical T cell zone for cognate antigen by means of an apparent random walk. This review attempts to summarize the current knowledge of factors influencing the basal migration behavior of naive T lymphocytes within lymph nodes during steady state. Extracellular cues, such as the motility-promoting influence of CCR7 ligands and the role of integrins during interstitial migration, as well as intracellular signaling pathways involved in T cell motility, will be discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on structural features of the lymph node environment orchestrating T cell migration, namely the network of fibroblastic reticular cells serving as migration "highways." Finally, new approaches to simulate the cellular dynamics within lymph nodes in silico by means of mathematical modeling will be reviewed.},

  Abstract                 = {Probabilistic inference of a phylogenetic tree from molecular sequence data is predicated on a substitution model describing the relative rates of change between character states along the tree for each site in the multiple sequence alignment. Commonly, one assumes that the substitution model is homogeneous across sites within large partitions of the alignment, assigns these partitions a priori, and then fixes their underlying substitution model to the best-fitting model from a hierarchy of named models. Here, we introduce an automatic model selection and model averaging approach within a Bayesian framework that simultaneously estimates the number of partitions, the assignment of sites to partitions, the substitution model for each partition, and the uncertainty in these selections. This new approach is implemented as an add-on to the BEAST 2 software platform. We find that this approach dramatically improves the fit of the nucleotide substitution model compared with existing approaches, and we show, using a number of example data sets, that as many as nine partitions are required to explain the heterogeneity in nucleotide substitution process across sites in a single gene analysis. In some instances, this improved modeling of the substitution process can have a measurable effect on downstream inference, including the estimated phylogeny, relative divergence times, and effective population size histories.},

DIGE and clCAT are familiar techniques used in geland LC-based quantitative proteomics, respectively. iTRAQ is a new LC-based technique which is gradually gaining in popularity. A systematic comparison among these quantitative methods has not been reported. In this study, we conducted well-designed comparisons using a six-protein mixture, a reconstituted protein mixture (BSA spiked into human plasma devoid of six abundant proteins), and complex HCT-116 cell lysates as the samples. All three techniques yielded quantitative results with reasonable accuracy when the six-protein or the reconstituted protein mixture was used. In DIGE, accurate quantification was sometimes compromised due to comigration or partial comigration of proteins. The iTRAQ method is more susceptible to errors in precursor ion isolation, which could be manifested with increasing sample complexity. The quantification sensitivity of each method was estimated by the number of peptides detected for each protein. In this regard, the global-tagging iTRAQ technique was more sensitive than the cysteine-specific cICAT method, which in turn was as sensitive as, if nol more sensitive than, the DIGE technique. Protein profiling on HCT-11 16 and HCT-116 p53 -/- cell lysales displayed limited overlapping among proteins identified by the three methods, suggesting the complementary nature of these methods.},

Here, to investigate how nucleosomes and silencing factors influence global gene expression, we use high-density arrays to study the effects of depleting nucleosomal histones and silencing factors in yeast. Reducing nucleosome content by depleting histone H4 caused increased expression of 15\% of genes and reduced expression of 10\% of genes, hut it had little effect on expression of the majority (75\%) of yeast genes, Telomere-proximal genes were found to be de-repressed over regions extending 20 kilobases from the telomeres, well beyond the extent of Sir protein binding(11,12) and the effects of loss of Sir function, These results indicate that histones make Sir-independent contributions to telomeric silencing, and that the role of histones located elsewhere in chromosomes is gene specific rather than generally repressive. },

  Abstract                 = {The rate of protein synthesis depends on both the rate of initiation of translation and the rate of elongation of the peptide chain. The rate of initiation depends on the encountering rate between ribosomes and {mRNA}; this rate in turn depends on the concentration of ribosomes and {mRNA}. Thus, patterns of codon usage that increase transcriptional efficiency should increase {mRNA} concentration, which in turn would increase the initiation rate and the rate of protein synthesis. An optimality model of the transcriptional process is presented with the prediction that the most frequently used ribonucleotide at the third codon sites in {mRNA} molecules should be the same as the most abundant ribonucleotide in the cellular matrix where {mRNA} is transcribed. This prediction is supported by four kinds of evidence. First, A-ending codons are the most frequently used synonymous codons in mitochondria, where ATP is much more abundant than that of the three other ribonucleotides. Second, A-ending codons are more frequently used in mitochondrial genes than in nuclear genes. Third, protein genes from organisms with a high metabolic rate use more A-ending codons and have higher A content in their introns than those from organisms with a low metabolic rate. },

The highest translational efficiency is achieved when the codon recognized by the most abundant {tRNA} reaches the maximum frequency. For each codon family, the {tRNA} concentration is optimally adapted to codon usage when the concentration of different {tRNA} species matches the square-root of the frequency of their corresponding synonymous codons. When {tRNA} concentration and codon usage are well adapted to each other, the optimal content of all {tRNA} species carrying the same amino acid should match the square-root of the frequency of the amino acid.

  Abstract                 = {The H-strand of vertebrate mitochondrial DNA is left single-stranded for hours during the slow DNA replication. This facilitates C-U mutations on the H-strand (and consequently G-A mutations on the L-strand) via spontaneous deamination which occurs much more frequently on single-stranded than on double-stranded DNA. For the 12 coding sequences (CDS) collinear with the L-strand, NNY synonymous codon families (where N stands for any of the four nucleotides and Y stands for either C or U) end mostly with C, and NNR and NNN codon families (where R stands for either A or G) end mostly with A. For the lone ND6 gene on the other strand, the codon bias is the opposite, with NNY codon families ending mostly with U and NNR and NNN codon families ending mostly with G. These patterns are consistent with the strand-specific mutation bias. The codon usage biased towards C-ending and A-ending in the 12 CDS sequences affects the codon-anticodon adaptation. The wobble site of the anticodon is always G for NNY codon farnilies dominated by C-ending codons and U for NNR and NNN codon families dominated by A-ending codons. The only, but consistent, exception is the anticodon of {tRNA}-Met which consistently has a 5' CAU-3' anticodon base-pairing with the AUG codon (the translation initiation codon) instead of the more frequent AUA. The observed CAU anticodon (matching AUG) would increase the rate of translation initiation but would reduce the rate of peptide elongation because most methionine codons are AUA, whereas the unobserved UAU anticodon (matching AUA) would increase the elongation rate at the cost of translation initiation rate. The consistent CAU anticodon in {tRNA}-Met suggests the importance of maximizing the rate of translation initiation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Fungal and animal mitochondrial genomes typically have one {tRNA} for each synonymous codon family. The codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis predicts that the wobble nucleotide of a {tRNA} anticodon should evolve towards maximizing Watson-Crick base pairing with the most frequently used codon within each synonymous codon family, whereas the wobble versatility hypothesis argues that the nucleotide at the wobble site should be occupied by a nucleotide most versatile in wobble pairing, i.e., the {tRNA} wobble nucleotide should be G for NNY codon families, and U for NNR and NNN codon families (where Y stands for C or U, R for A or G and N for any nucleotide). Results: We here integrate these two traditional hypotheses on {tRNA} anticodons into a unified model based on an analysis of the wobble costs associated with different wobble base pairs. This novel approach allows the relative cost of wobble pairing to be qualitatively evaluated. A comprehensive study of 36 fungal genomes suggests very different costs between two kinds of U: G wobble pairs, i.e., (1) between a G at the wobble site of a {tRNA} anticodon and a U at the third codon position (designated M-U3:G) and (2) between a U at the wobble site of a {tRNA} anticodon and a G at the third codon position (designated M-G3:U). Conclusion: In general, MU3: G is much smaller than MG3: U, suggesting no selection against U-ending codons in NNY codon families with a wobble G in the {tRNA} anticodon but strong selection against G-ending codons in NNR codon families with a wobble U at the {tRNA} anticodon. This finding resolves several puzzling observations in fungal genomics and corroborates previous studies showing that U3:G wobble is energetically more favorable than G3:U wobble. },

  Abstract                 = {Infectious diseases provide a particularly clear illustration of the spatiotemporal underpinnings of consumer-resource dynamics. The paradigm is provided by extremely contagious, acute, immunizing childhood infections. Partially synchronized, unstable oscillations are punctuated by local extinctions. This, in turn, can result in spatial differentiation in the timing of epidemics and, depending on the nature of spatial contagion, may result in traveling waves. Measles epidemics are one of a few systems documented well enough to reveal all of these properties and how they are affected by spatiotemporal variations in population structure and demography. On the basis of a gravity coupling model and a time series susceptible-infected-recovered (TSIR) model for local dynamics, we propose a metapopulation model for regional measles dynamics. The model can capture all the major spatiotemporal properties in prevaccination epidemics of measles in England and Wales.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, an interesting question has emerged in the evolutionary interpretation of sequence substitution data as evidence of amino acid selection pressure. Specifically, the Ka/Ks metric was designed to measure selection pressure on amino acid substitutions, assuming that the synonymous substitution rate Ks reflects the neutral nucleotide substitution rate. However, there is increasing evidence for selection pressure at silent sites due to constraints of RNA splicing. Is Ka/Ks an appropriate metric for selection pressure on amino acid substitutions, in the presence of other selection pressures acting only at the RNA level (such as selection for exonic splicing enhancers)? Or can the resulting decreases in Ks from such selection pressures introduce bias into the Ka/Ks metric, so that it no longer gives an accurate measure of amino acid level selection pressure? In this review, we present both mathematical models and empirical evidence for these divergent points of view. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. },

Methods: A mathematical model was developed for the spread of HIV infection among young homosexual men in Amsterdam after the introduction of HAART. The model describes the formation of both steady and casual partnerships. Behavioural parameters were estimated separately for steady and casual partners from the Amsterdam Cohort Study among young homosexual men. HIV incidence and the fraction of new infections attributed to casual contacts were calculated from the model, allowing for uncertainty in the increases in risky behaviour, the effect of HAART, and levels of HIV testing and HAART administration. Results: Currently, 86\% (range 74-90\%) of new HIV infections occur within steady partnerships. A reduction of 75-99\% in infectivity caused by HAART will be counterbalanced by increases of 50\% (range 30-80\%) in risky behaviour with steady partners, but not by increases of up to 100\% with casual partners. If HIV testing is increased from 42 to 80\% and HAART administration from 70 to 85\%, then even an increase of 100\% in risk-taking with steady partners will not outweigh the effect of HAART. Conclusion: Most new HIV infections among homosexual men in Amsterdam occur within steady relationships. Prevention measures should address risky behaviour, specifically with steady partners, and the promotion of HIV testing. (C) 2003 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.}

Methods: A mathematical model describing HIV transmission among homosexual men was developed. In the model, men are involved in both steady and casual partnerships. Infectivity is higher during PHI than during chronic HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces infectivity and increases the time to the development of AIDS. Its effect is enhanced if treatment is initiated during PHI. HIV incidence and the fraction of transmission attributed to PHI were calculated for different levels of treatment efficacy. Results: Primary infections account for 35\% of HIV transmissions from casual partners and 6\% of transmissions from steady partners. Among all new infections, only 11\% occurs during PHI. Therefore, the effect of treatment during PHI on the incidence of HIV is limited. However, in a community with higher risky behaviour among casual partners, the fraction of transmission attributed to PHI increases to 25\%. Conclusion: Primary infections play a more important role in transmission from casual partners than in transmission from steady partners. Therefore, in communities in which steady partners account for the majority of new infections and the epidemic is at an advanced phase, the contribution of PHI to the transmission of HIV is rather small and the effect of early treatment on the incidence of HIV is limited.

The quantitation levels obtained are compared to data using densitometric analysis of silver or amido black staining and to the theoretical expression level (codon bias) of the identified proteins determined from their amino acid analysis (AAA). The results show that relative volume ratio (PERCENTvol) using Melanie II is a better parameter for spot quantitation than relative optical density ratio (PERCENTOD), and amino black staining provides good linearity within the range 1-100 pmol protein. However, AAA shows that theoretical expression levels are not well correlated with actual protein expression level, although there is better correlation when isoforms of the expressed protein are identified and included. It is concluded that amino acid analysis provides accurate protein quantitation and has a continuing role in proteome studies in terms of the rapid and inexpensive quantitation of proteins displayed on proteome maps. We do however recognize that in the context of future clinical applications and large-scale proteome discovery projects, quantitation and post-translational modification need to be analyzed by 'proteomatic' (ie., proteome automatic bioinformatic analysis directly from the gel) techniques.},

We decided to measure {mRNA} decay rates in two human cell lines with high-density oligonucleotide arrays that enable the measurement of decay rates simultaneously for thousands of {mRNA} species. Using existing annotation and the Gene Ontology hierarchy of biological processes, we assign mRNAs to functional classes at various levels of resolution and compare the decay rate statistics between these classes. The results show statistically significant organizational principles in the variation of decay rates among functional classes. In particular, transcription factor mRNAs have increased average decay rates compared with other transcripts and are enriched in "fast-decaying" mRNAs with half-lives <2 h. In contrast, we find that mRNAs for biosynthetic proteins have decreased average decay rates and are deficient in fast-decaying mRNAs. Our analysis of data from a previously published study of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {mRNA} decay shows the same functional organization of decay rates, implying that it is a general organizational scheme for eukaryotes. Additionally, we investigated the dependence of decay rates on sequence composition, that is, the presence or absence of short {mRNA} motifs in various regions of the {mRNA} transcript. Our analysis recovers the positive correlation of {mRNA} decay with known AU-rich {mRNA} motifs, but we also uncover further short {mRNA} motifs that show statistically significant correlation with decay. However, we also note that none of these motifs are strong predictors of {mRNA} decay rate, indicating that the regulation of {mRNA} decay is more complex and may involve the cooperative binding of several {RNA}-binding proteins at different sites.},

However, little is reported of their pattern during protein structural evolution. We investigated the distribution of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) along mammal and fruit fly proteins. We found the nsSNPs (and d(N)) and indels increased in protein boundary regions, and this pattern is inversely correlated with the distribution of protein domain density. Additionally, synonymous substitutions (and d(S)) are reduced in 51 and 31 regions, indicating more variable protein boundaries, compared with central interior. All evidence suggests that the inner part of coding sequences (CDSs) is comparatively conserved, whereas the 5' and 3' regions, with higher evolution rates, are more variable. We assumed that due to greater frequencies of nsSNPs and indels in adaptive regions of CDSs it could be easier to ultimately alter, gain, or lose amino acids, thus becoming the front line of protein evolution.

"Empirical" models do not explicitly consider factors that shape protein evolution, but attempt to summarize the substitution pattern from large quantities of real data. "Mechanistic" models are formulated at the codon level and separate mutational biases at the nucleotide level from selective constraints at the amino acid level. They account for features of sequence evolution, such as transition-transversion bias and base or codon frequency biases, and make use of physicochemical distances between amino acids to specify nonsynonymous substitution rates. A general approach is presented that transforms a Markov model of codon substitution into a model of amino acid replacement. Protein sequences from the entire mitochondrial genomes of 20 mammalian species were analyzed using different models. The mechanistic models were found to fit the data better than empirical models derived from large databases. Both the mutational distance between amino acids (determined by the genetic code and mutational biases such as the transition-transversion bias) and the physicochemical distance are found to have strong effects on amino acid substitution rates. A significant proportion of amino acid substitutions appeared to have involved more than one codon position, indicating that nucleotide substitutions at neighboring sites may be correlated. Rates of amino acid substitution were found to be highly variable among sites. ER},

  Abstract                 = {Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation, which allow variable rates of substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first, called the ''discrete gamma model,'' uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method, called ''fixed-rates model,'' classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest trees are often found to be zero. The computational requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368-376) model, which assumes a single rate for all the sites.},

  Abstract                 = {PAML, currently in version 4, is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA and protein sequences using maximum likelihood (ML). The programs may be used to compare and test phylogenetic trees, but their main strengths lie in the rich repertoire of evolutionary models implemented, which can be used to estimate parameters in models of sequence evolution and to test interesting biological hypotheses.

  Abstract                 = {Approximate methods for estimating the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between two DNA sequences involve three steps: counting of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in the two sequences, counting of synonymous and nonsynonymous differences between the two sequences, and correcting for multiple substitutions at the same site. We examine complexities involved in those steps and propose a new approximate method that takes into account two major features of DNA sequence evolution: transition/transversion rate bias and base/codon frequency bias. We compare the new method with maximum likelihood, as well as several other approximate methods, by examining infinitely long sequences, performing computer simulations, and analyzing a real data set. The results suggest that when there are transition/transversion rate biases and base/codon frequency biases, previously described approximate methods for estimating the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio may involve serious biases, and the bias can be both positive and negative. The new method is, in general, superior to earlier approximate methods and may be useful for analyzing large data sets, although maximum likelihood appears to always be the method of choice.},

  Abstract                 = {Current models of codon substitution are formulated at the levels of nucleotide substitution and do not explicitly consider the separate effects of mutation and selection. They are thus incapable of inferring whether mutation or selection is responsible for evolution at silent sites. Here we implement a few population genetics models of codon substitution that explicitly consider mutation bias and natural selection at the DNA level. Selection on codon usage is modeled by introducing codon-fitness parameters, which together with mutation-bias parameters, predict optimal codon frequencies for the gene. The selective pressure may be for translational efficiency and accuracy or for fine-tuning translational kinetics to produce correct protein folding. We apply the models to compare mitochondrial and nuclear genes from several mammalian species. Model assumptions concerning codon usage are found to affect the estimation of sequence distances (such as the synonymous rate d(S), the nonsynonymous rate d(N), and the rate at the 4-fold degenerate sites d(4)), as found in previous studies, but the new models produced very similar estimates to some old ones. We also develop a likelihood ratio test to examine the null hypothesis that codon usage is due to mutation bias alone, not influenced by natural selection. Application of the test to the mammalian data led to rejection of the null hypothesis in most genes, suggesting that natural selection may be a driving force in the evolution of synonymous codon usage in mammals. Estimates of selection coefficients nevertheless suggest that selection on codon usage is weak and most mutations are nearly neutral. The sensitivity of the analysis on the assumed mutation model is discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {The perpetuation of most eukaryotic species requires differentiation of pluripotent progenitors into egg and sperm and subsequent fusion of these gametes to form a new zygote. Meiosis is a distinguishing feature of gamete formation as it leads to the twofold reduction in chromosome number thereby maintaining ploidy across generations. This process increases offspring diversity through the random segregation of chromosomes and the exchange of genetic material between homologous parental chromosomes, known as meiotic crossover recombination. These exchanges require the establishment of unique and dynamic chromatin configurations that facilitate cohesion, homolog pairing, synapsis, double strand break formation and repair. The precise orchestration of these events is critical for gamete survival as demonstrated by the majority of human aneuploidies that can be traced to defects in the first meiotic division (Hassold T, Hall H, Hunt P: The origin of human aneuploidy: where we have been, where we are going. Hum Mol Genet 2007, 16 Spec No. 2:R203-R208.). This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of key meiotic events and how coordination of these events is occurring. },

We show that {tRNA} species translating 2-fold degenerate codons require a modified U-34 to enable recognition of their cognate codons ending in A or G but restrict reading of noncognate or near-cognate codons ending in U and C that specify a different amino acid. In particular, the nucleoside modifications 2-thiouridine at position 34 (s(2)U(34)), 5-methylaminomethyluridine at position 34 (mnm(5)U(34)), and 6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (t(6)A(37)) were essential for Watson-Crick (AAA) and wobble (AAG) cognate codon recognition by {tRNA}(UUU)(Lys), at the ribosomal aminoacyl and peptidyl sites but did not enable the recognition of the asparagine codons (AAU and AAC).

We propose that a significant source of self and viral peptides are defective ribosomal products (DRiPs), which consist of prematurely terminated polypeptides and misfolded polypeptides produced from translation of bona fide mRNAs in the proper reading frame. DRiPs are produced entropically, due to the inevitable imperfections inherent to protein synthesis or folding. To accelerate recognition of cells harboring intracellular parasites such as viruses, DRiP formation may be enhanced by changes in the cellular physiology induced by infection or by exposure of cells to cytokines released at the site of inflammation.},

  Abstract                 = {An \emph{{E}scherichia coli} strain containing two plasmids was developed for \emph{in vivo} isolation of the phage SP6 RNA polymerase mutants. It was developed to isolate mutants with increased proficiency of termination at the SP6 terminator and/or with reduced elongation processivity. Mutations were randomly introduced into an N-terminal third of the polymerase gene that was placed under a Inc promoter in one plasmid. In the other plasmid, a promoter-lacking lacZ gene modified for reduced translation efficiency was placed downstream of a tandem pair of the SP6 terminator located downstream of an SP6 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Termination-up mutants were selected \emph{in vivo} as they rendered LacZ activity level lower than the wild-type, without reducing chloramphenicol resistance substantially. Three such mutants (M15L, M15S, and D117G) were purified, and their termination efficiencies were measured \emph{in vitro} at two different intrinsic termination signals in the E. coli rrnB terminator tl that are different in requiring RNA hairpin formation. All three mutations enhanced termination efficiencies \emph{in vitro} at the SP6 terminator and the upstream signal of rnnB tl, but reduced the efficiency at the downstream signal of it. All the mutations reduced elongation processivity, as the mutants produced much less amounts of large transcripts (2.1 kb) than the wild-type but the similar amounts of small transcripts (up to 670 nt). Thus, the mutations, all reducing elongation processivity of the polymerase, exhibited opposite effects on the two types of intrinsic termination signals, suggesting that the two mechanisms involve different interactions with the phage RNA polymerase.

In this article, we present a novel network-based framework for reconstructing the evolutionary history of protein complexes. Our analysis is based on generalizing evolutionary measures for single proteins to the level of whole subnetworks, comprehensively considering a broad set of computationally derived complexes and accounting for both sequence and interaction changes. Specifically, we compute sets of orthologous complexes across species, and use these to derive evolutionary rate and age measures for protein complexes. We observe significant correlations between the evolutionary properties of a complex and those of its member proteins, suggesting that protein complexes form early in evolution and evolve as coherent units. Additionally, our approach enables us to directly quantify the extent to which gene duplication has played a role in the evolution of complexes. We find that about one quarter of the sets of orthologous complexes have originated from evolutionary cores of homodimers that underwent duplication and divergence, testifying to the important role of gene duplication in protein complex evolution. },

What determines where meiotic DSBs are created and whether a crossover or non-crossover will be formed at any particular DSB remains largely unclear. Nevertheless, several recent papers have revealed important insights into the factors that control the decision between crossover and non-crossover formation in meiosis, including DNA elements that determine the positioning of meiotic DSBs, and the generation and processing of recombination intermediates. In this review, we focus on the factors that influence DSB positioning, the proteins required for the formation of recombination intermediates and how the processing of these structures generates either a crossover or non-crossover in various organisms. A discussion of crossover interference, assurance and homeostasis, which influence crossing over on a chromosome-wide and genome-wide scale - in addition to current models for the generation of interference - is also included. This Commentary aims to highlight recent advances in our understanding of the factors that promote or prevent meiotic crossing over.},

Here we used a Neurospora cell-free translation system to directly monitor the velocity of mRNA translation. We demonstrated that the preferred codons enhance the rate of translation elongation, whereas non-optimal codons slow elongation. Codon usage also controls ribosome traffic on mRNA. These conclusions were supported by ribosome profiling results in vitro and in vivo with template mRNAs designed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we demonstrate that codon usage regulates protein function by affecting co-translational protein folding.

Our results show that pairs of Ac/fAc elements in which the termini of different elements are in direct or reverse orientation can induce chromosome breakage. By contrast, no chromosome breakage is observed with alleles containing pairs of Ac/fAc elements in which the external termini of the paired elements can function as a macrotransposon. Among the structures that can lead to chromosome breaks, breakage frequency is inversely correlated with the distance between the interacting Ac/Ds termini.

  Abstract                 = {Translation errors in protein biosynthesis may result in low level amino acid misincorporation and contribute to product heterogeneity of recombinant protein therapeutics. We report the use of peptide map analysis by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry to detect and identify mistranslation events in recombinant monoclonal antibodies expressed in mammalian cell lines including Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Misincorporation of an asparagine residue at multiple serine positions was detected as earlier-eluting peptides with masses 27.01 Da higher than expected. The exact positions at which misincorporation occurred were identified by tandem mass spectrometry of the asparagine-containing variant peptides. The identified asparagine misincorporation sites correlated with the use of codon AGC but with none of the other five serine codons. The relative levels of misincorporation ranged from 0.01\%-0.2\% among multiple serine positions detected across three different antibodies by targeted analysis of expected and variant peptides. The low levels of misincorporation are consistent with published predictions for in vivo translation error rates. Our results demonstrate that state-of-the-art mass spectrometry with a combination of high sensitivity, accuracy, and dynamic range provides a new ability to discover and characterize low level protein variants that arise from mistranslation events.},

  Abstract                 = {The secondary structure and sequences influencing the expression and selection of the AUG initiator codon in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated with two fused genes, which were composed of either the CYC7 or CYC1 leader regions, respectively, linked to the lacZ coding region. In addition, the strains contained the upf1-Delta disruption, which stabilized {mRNA}s that had premature termination codons, resulting in wild-type levels. The following major conclusions were reached by measuring beta-galactosidase activities in yeast strains having integrated single copies of the fused genes with various alterations in the 89 and 38 nucleotide-long untranslated CYC7 and CYC1 leader regions, respectively. The leader region adjacent to the AUG initiator codon was dispensable, but the nucleotide preceding the AUG initiator at position -3 modified the efficiency of translation by less than twofold, exhibiting an order of preference A>G>C>U, Upstream out-of-frame AUG triplets diminished initiation at the normal site, from essentially complete inhibition to approximately 50\% inhibition, depending on the position of the upstream AUG triplet and on the context (-3 position nucleotides) of the two AUG triplets. In this regard, complete inhibition occurred when the upstream and downstream AUG triplets were closer together, and when the upstream and downstream AUG triplets had, respectively, optimal and suboptimal contexts. Thus, leaky scanning occurs in yeast, similar to its occurrence in higher eukaryotes. In contrast, termination codons between two AUG triplets causes reinitiation at the downstream AUG in higher eukaryotes, but not generally in yeast. Our results and the results of others with GCN4 {mRNA} and its derivatives indicate that reinitiation is not a general phenomenon in yeast, and that special sequences are required.}

  Abstract                 = {Faithful decoding of the genetic information by the ribosome relies on kinetically driven mechanisms that promote selection of cognate substrates during elongation. Recently, we have shown that in addition to these kinetically driven mechanisms, the ribosome possesses a post peptidyl transfer quality control system that retrospectively monitors the codon-anticodon interaction in the P site, triggering substantial losses in the specificity of the A site during subsequent tRNA and RF selection when a mistake has occurred. Here, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of tRNA selection in the context of a mismatched P-site codon: anticodon interaction. We observe pleiotropic effects of a P-site mismatch on tRNA selection, such that near-cognate tRNA is processed by the ribosome almost as efficiently as cognate. In particular, after a miscoding event, near-cognate codon-anticodon complexes are stabilized on the ribosome to an extent similar to that observed for cognate ones. Moreover, the two observed forward rates of GTPase activation and accommodation are greatly accelerated (similar to 10-fold)for nearcognatet RNAs. Because the ensemble of effects of a mismatched P site on substrate selection were found to be different from those reported for other ribosomal perturbations and miscoding agents, we propose that the structural integrity of the mRNA-tRNA helix in the P site provides a distinct molecular switch that dictates the specificity of the A site.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical population genetics a priori assigns fitness to alleles without considering molecular or functional properties of proteins that these alleles encode. Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes can then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma-dimensional hypercube with adsorbing boundaries determined, in each dimension, by loss of a protein's stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences. Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size, and thermodynamic response of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately six mutations per essential part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and one to two mutations per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Several RNA viruses function close to the evolutionary speed limit, whereas error correction mechanisms used by DNA viruses and nonmutant strains of bacteria featuring various genome lengths and mutation rates have brought these organisms universally approximate to 1,000-fold below the natural speed limit. },

Such alterations were achieved by global acceleration of the translation rate with tRNA excess in vitro or by synonymous substitutions to codons with highly abundant tRNAs both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, the global slow-down of the translation rate modulated by low temperature suppresses the deleterious effect of the altered translational attenuation pattern. We propose that local discontinuous translation temporally separates the translation of segments of the peptide chain and actively coordinates their co-translational folding.

We have developed an algorithm to evaluate the relative rate of translation which allows large-scale comparisons of the non-uniform translation rate on the protein biogenesis. Using the complete genomes of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis we show that stretches of codons pairing to minor {tRNA}s form putative sites to locally attenuate translation; thereby the tendency is to cluster in near proximity whereas long contiguous stretches of slow-translating triplets are avoided. The presence of slow-translating segments positively correlates with the protein length irrespective of the protein abundance. The slow-translating clusters are predominantly located down-stream of the domain boundaries presumably to fine-tune translational accuracy with the folding fidelity of multidomain proteins. Translation attenuation patterns at highly structurally and functionally conserved domains are preserved across the species suggesting a concerted selective pressure on the codon selection and species-specific {tRNA} abundance in these regions.},

In the present study, we investigated the translational effects of intragenic differential codon usage on the expression of the new Drosophila gene, jingwei (jgw), a chimera derived from two unrelated parental genes: Ymp and Adh. We found that jgw possesses a strong intragenic differential usage of synonymous codons, i.e. the Adh-derived C-domain has a significantly higher codon bias than that of the Ymp-derived N-domain (P=0.0023 by t-test). Additional evolutionary analysis revealed the heterogeneous distribution of rare codons, implicating its role in gene regulation and protein translation. The \emph{in vitro} expression of jgw further demonstrated that the heterogeneous distribution of rare codons has played a role in regulating gene expression, particularly, affecting the quality of protein translation. \&COPY; 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Based on their collinear order along the two chromosomes, the gene pairs were likely duplicated contemporaneously, and therefore comparison of genetic distances among gene pairs provides insights into the distribution of nucleotide substitution rates among plant nuclear genes. Rates of synonymous substitution varied 13.8-fold among the duplicated gene pairs, but 90\% of gene pairs differed by less than 2.6-fold. Average nonsynonymous rates were approximate tofivefold lower than average synonymous rates; this rate difference is lower than that of previously studied nonplant lineages. The coefficient of variation of rates among genes was 0.65 for nonsynonymous rates and 0.44 for synonymous rates, indicating that synonymous and nonsynonymous rates vary among genes to roughly the same extent. The causes underlying rate variation were explored. Our analyses tentatively suggest an effect of physical location on synonymous substitution rates but no similar effect on nonsynonymous rates. Nonsynonymous substitution rates were negatively correlated with GC content at synonymous third codon positions, and synonymous substitution rates were negatively correlated with codon bias, as observed in other systems. Finally, the 242 gene pairs permitted investigation of the processes underlying divergence between paralogs. We found no evidence of positive selection, little evidence that paralogs evolve at different rates, and no evidence of differential codon usage or third position GC content. },

  Abstract                 = {Background: Approximate methods for estimating nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (Ka and Ks) among protein-coding sequences have adopted different mutation (substitution) models. In the past two decades, several methods have been proposed but they have not considered unequal transitional substitutions (between the two purines, A and G, or the two pyrimidines, T and C) that become apparent when sequences data to be compared are vast and significantly diverged. Results: We propose a new method (MYN), a modified version of the Yang-Nielsen algorithm (YN), for evolutionary analysis of protein-coding sequences in general. MYN adopts the Tamura-Nei Model that considers the difference among rates of transitional and transversional substitutions as well as factors in codon frequency bias. We evaluate the performance of MYN by comparing to other methods, especially to YN, and to show that MYN has minimal deviations when parameters vary within normal ranges defined by empirical data. Conclusion: Our comparative results deriving from consistency analysis, computer simulations and authentic datasets, indicate that ignoring unequal transitional rates may lead to serious biases and that MYN performs well in most of the tested cases. These results also suggest that acquisitions of reliable synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates primarily depend on less biased estimates of transition/transversion rate ratio. },

Mapping of TSS in S. cerevisiae has the potential to contribute to our understanding of gene regulation, transcription, {mRNA} stability and aspects of RNA biology. Here, we use 50 SAGE to map 50 TSS in S. cerevisiae. Tags identifying the first 15-17 bases of the transcripts are created, ligated to form ditags, amplified, concatemerized and ligated into a vector to create a library. Each clone sequenced from this library identifies 10-20 TSS. We have identified 13 746 unique, unambiguous sequence tags from 2231 S. cerevisiae genes. TSS identified in this study are consistent with published results, with primer extension results described here, and are consistent with expectations based on previous work on transcription initiation. We have aligned the sequence flanking 4637 TSS to identify the consensus sequence A(A(rich))(5)NPyA(A/T)NN(A(rich))(6), which confirms and expands the previous reported PyA(A/T) Pu consensus pattern. The TSS data allowed the identification of a previously unrecognized gene, uncovered errors in previous annotation, and identified potential regulatory RNAs and upstream open reading frames in 50'-untranslated region.},

Our approach is based on the observation that the structure, including the uORFs, of the post-transcriptionally uORF regulated Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes GCN4 and CPA1 is conserved in related species. Thirty-eight candidate genes for which uORFs were found in multiple species were identified and tested. We determined by 5' RACE that 15 of these 38 genes are transcribed. Most of these 15 genes have only a single uORF in their 5' UTR, and the length of these uORFs range from 3 to 24 codons. We cloned seven full-length UTR sequences into a luciferase (LUC) reporter system. Luciferase activity and {mRNA} level were compared between the wild-type UTR construct and a construct where the uORF start codon was mutated. The translational efficiency index (TEI) of each construct was calculated to test the possible regulatory function on translational level. We hypothesize that uORFs in the UTR of RPC11, TPK1, FOL1, WSC3, and MKK1 may have translational regulatory roles while uORFs in the 5' UTR of ECM7 and IMD4 have little effect on translation under the conditions tested. }

In this study, we establish a direct in vivo link between ER dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Mice homozygous with respect to the woozy ( wz) mutation develop adultonset ataxia with cerebellar Purkinje cell loss. Affected cells have intracellular protein accumulations reminiscent of protein inclusions in both the ER and the nucleus. In addition, upregulation of the unfolded protein response, suggestive of ER stress, occurs in mutant Purkinje cells. We report that the wz mutation disrupts the gene Sil1 that encodes an adenine nucleotide exchange factor of BiP3, a crucial ER chaperone(4). These findings provide evidence that perturbation of ER chaperone function in terminally differentiated neurons leads to protein accumulation, ER stress and subsequent neurodegeneration.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new computational method to identify positive and purifying selection at synonymous sites in yeast and worm. We define synonymous substitutions that change codons from preferred to unpreferred or vice versa as nonconservative synonymous substitutions and all other substitutions as conservative. Using a maximum-likelihood framework, we then test whether conservative and nonconservative synonymous substitutions occur at equal rates. Our approach replaces the standard rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, dS, with two new rates, the conservative synonymous substitution rate (dS(C)) and the nonconservative synonymous substitution rate (dS(N)). Based on the ratio dS(N)/dS(C), we find that 0.05\% of all yeast genes and none of worm genes show evidence of positive selection at synonymous sites (dS(N)/dS(C) > 1). On the other hand, 9.44\% of all yeast genes and 5.12\% of all worm genes show evidence of significant purifying selection on synonymous sites (dS(N)/dS(C) < 1). We also find that dS(N) correlates strongly with gene expression level, whereas the correlation between expression level and dS(C) is very weak. Thus, dS(N) captures most of the signal of selection for translational accuracy and speed, whereas dS(C) is not strongly influenced by this selection pressure. We suggest that the ratio dN/dS(C) may be more appropriate than the ratio dN/dS to identify positive or purifying selection on amino acids.},

  Abstract                 = {The mistranslation-induced protein misfolding hypothesis predicts that selection should prefer high-fidelity codons at sites at which translation errors are structurally disruptive and lead to protein misfolding and aggregation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the relationship between codon usage bias and protein structure in the genomes of four model organisms, Escherichia coli, yeast, fly, and mouse. Using both the Mantel-Haenszel procedure, which applies to categorical data, and a newly developed association test for continuous variables, we find that translationally optimal codons associate with buried residues and also with residues at sites where mutations lead to large changes in free energy (delta delta G). In each species, only a subset of all amino acids show this signal, but most amino acids show the signal in at least one species. By repeating the analysis on a reduced data set that excludes interdomain linkers, we show that our results are not caused by an association of rare codons with solvent-accessible linker regions. Finally, we find that our results depend weakly on expression level; the association between optimal codons and buried sites exists at all expression levels, but increases in strength as expression level increases. },

Networks based on different types of data are compared using metrics devised to assess the predictive power of a network. We show that a network reconstructed by integrating genotypic, TFBS and PPI data is the most predictive. This network is used to predict causal regulators responsible for hot spots of gene expression activity in a segregating yeast population. We also show that the network can elucidate the mechanisms by which causal regulators give rise to larger-scale changes in gene expression activity. We then prospectively validate predictions, providing direct experimental evidence that predictive networks can be constructed by integrating multiple, appropriate data types. },

  Abstract                 = {The biophysical properties of membrane phospholipids are controlled by the composition of their constituent fatty acids and are tightly regulated in Escherichia coli. The FabR (fatty acid biosynthesis repressor) transcriptional repressor controls the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane by regulating the expression of the fabB (beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I) and fabA (beta-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP dehydratase/isomerase) genes. FabR binding to a DNA palindrome located within the promoters of the fabB and fabA genes required the presence of an unsaturated acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) or acyl-CoA and was antagonized by saturated acyl-ACP or acyl-CoA. The FabR-dependent repression of fabB and fabA by exogenous unsaturated fatty acids confirmed the role for FabR in responding to the acyl-CoA pool composition, and the perturbation of the unsaturated: saturated acyl-ACP ratio using a specific inhibitor of lipid A formation verified FabR-dependent regulation of fabB by the acyl-ACP composition in vivo. Thus, FabR plays a key role in controlling the membrane biophysical properties by regulating gene expression in response to the composition of the long-chain acyl-thioester pool. This mechanism ensures that a balanced composition of fatty acids is available for incorporation into the membrane via the PlsB/PlsC acyltransferases. },

  Abstract                 = {The hundreds of human olfactory receptor (OR) genes are organized into clusters occurring on nearly every chromosome. Although their sequences are not always closely related, they share stretches of considerable similarity, both at the amino acid and nucleotide levels. We demonstrate here that an HLA complex-linked OR sequence, FAT11, for which recently a number of alleles have been claimed within the Hutterites, contains sequences derived from two closely related, linked OR genes, hs6M1-12 and hs6M1-16. Instead of indicating a difference between alleles of a given locus, two of the polymorphisms described for FAT11 (at amino acids 48 and 220 of the deduced protein sequence, respectively) may in fact reflect distinct sequences of hs6M1-12 and a further, closely related HLA-linked OR locus, hs6M1-13P. As a consequence, recombination rates in Hutterites in the region telomeric of HLA-G may have to be reconsidered.},

The growth of plants and animals are described by nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Biologically justified limitations provide additional inequality constraints on the control functions and the state variable. The solutions of the optimization models are control functions which either maximize the amounts of energy allocated to reproduction or minimize the age of achieving adult body size. }

  Abstract                 = {The identification of genomic regions that have been exposed to positive selection is a major challenge in population genetics. Since selective sweeps are expected to occur during environmental changes or when populations are colonizing a new habitat, statistical tests constructed on the assumption of constant population size are biased by the co-occurrence of population size changes and selection. To delimit this problem and gain better insights into demographic factors, theroretical results regarding the second-order moments of segregating sites, such as the variance of segregating sites, have been derived. Driven by emergin genomewide surveys, which allow the estimation of demographic parameters, a generalized version of Tajima's D has been derived that takes into account a previously estimated demographic scenario to test single loci for traces of selection against the null hypothesis of neutral evolution under variable populaion size.},

  Abstract                 = {Amino acid substitution matrices describe the rates by which amino acids are replaced during evolution. In contrast to nucleotide or codon models, amino acid substitution matrices are in general parameterless and empirically estimated, probably because there is no obvious parametrization for amino acid substitutions. Principal component analysis has previously been used to improve codon substitution models by empirically finding the most relevant parameters. Here, we apply the same method to amino acid substitution matrices, leading to a semiempirical substitution model that can adjust the transition rates to the protein sequences under investigation. Our new model almost invariably achieves the best likelihood values in large-scale comparisons with established amino acid substitution models (JTT, WAG, and LG). In particular for longer alignments, these likelihood gains are considerably larger than what could be expected from simply having more parameters. The application of our model differs from that of mixture models (such as UL2 or UL3), as we optimize one rate matrix per alignment, whereas mixture models apply the variation per alignments site. This makes our model computationally more efficient, while the performance is comparable to that of UL3. Applied to the phylogenetic problem of the origin of placental mammals, our new model and the UL3 mixed model are the only ones of the tested models that cluster Afrotheria and Xenarthra into a clade called Atlantogenata, which would be in correspondence with recent findings using more sophisticated phylogenetic methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Technological advances over the past 10 years have generated powerful tools for parallel analysis of complex biological problems. Among these new technologies, DNA arrays have provided an important experimental approach for identifying changes in the levels of individual {mRNA} molecules during important cellular transitions. However, cellular behavior is dictated not by {mRNA} levels, but by the proteins translated from the individual {mRNA} species. We report a high-throughput method for simultaneously monitoring the translation state and level of individual {mRNA} species. Messenger RNAs from resting and mitogenically activated fibroblasts were separated, according to degree of ribosome loading, into well-translated and under-translated pools. cDNA probes generated from these fractions were used to interrogate cDNA arrays. Among approximately 1,200 genes analyzed, less than 1\% were found to be translationally regulated in response to mitogenic activation, demonstrating the strong selectivity of this regulatory mechanism. This high-throughput approach is shown to be an effective tool for superimposing translation profile on {mRNA} level for large numbers of genes, as well as for identifying translationally regulated genes for further study.},
